&lt;h2 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On this page I am detailing my process when building a new modded setup. This is more intended as a general guideline rather than a set of hard-and-fast rules and how you approach building a setup can (should!) depend heavily on what you specifically intend to create. That being said, I hope this can serve as a blueprint in case you are unsure how to proceed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A new setup always begins with a good amount of spring-cleaning and basic steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use this time to think about mods and themes for the setup you want to build: Are you going for heavily overhauled visuals with tough survival gameplay? Are you interested in EnaiRim extravaganza with Legacy of the Dragonborn? Are you looking to try every quest mod on the Nexus? You still have plenty of time to make up your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Perform a &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/clean-install/">Clean Install&lt;/a> of Skyrim SE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up a new instance of &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/mo2/">Mod Organizer 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/managing-creations/">Import your Creations&lt;/a> into Mod Organizer 2.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>If you are on the fence about Creations, read the section below.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Optional:&lt;/strong> Install &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/root-builder/">Root Builder&lt;/a> for Mod Organizer 2.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Root Builder is required for various modules/articles available here and I highly recommend installing it.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/skyrim-script-extender/">Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/a> and related mods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up a &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/tools-folder/">Tools Folder&lt;/a> and install necessary tools (see section below).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="creation-club">Creation Club&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At this point everyone owns at least the four free Creations (Fishing, Survival, Rare Curios, Saints &amp;amp; Seducers), though not everyone picked up the remaining Creations or the full Anniversary Edition DLC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Forgoing the AE DLC should not negatively impact your modding experience but skipping the four free Creations is difficult as nn increasing amount of mods, including the &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266">Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/a>, now require them. Skipping the USSEP significantly complicates matters simply because it is in turn required by a vast amount of mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you are completely opposed to using the four free Creations, I recommend installing them. Survival Mode can be easily neutralised by &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59049">disabling the prompt&lt;/a> and the mediocre Saints &amp;amp; Seducers quest can be completely replaced with &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772">a full remake&lt;/a>. Finally, the Fishing quests can be removed by installing the &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80379">reduced cut&lt;/a>. This may be a good compromise between removing poor quality Creation content from your game while still being able to keep the plugins as master files to dependent mods like the USSEP.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only tool that everyone should install before touching mods is &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/">SSEEdit&lt;/a>. Yes, you need it, no matter what. Most other tools are situational and can be installed later on when they are needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, I would recommend setting up at least the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/">SSEEdit&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/creation-kit/">Creation Kit&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/cao/">Cathedral Assets Optimizer&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/bae/">Bethesda Archive Extractor&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="basic-mods">Basic Mods&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If, at this point, you are still uncertain about central mods and themes for your new setup, there is no need to worry as there is more baseline work to be. What is considered an &amp;ldquo;essential&amp;rdquo; mods is actually more subjective and controversial than one might assume which is why I largely give recommendations.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Recommendations: &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/recommended-mods/utilities-frameworks">Utilities &amp;amp; Frameworks&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recommendations: &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/recommended-mods/essential-mods">Essential Mods&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As you begin to build up your mod order, try to keep it nice and clean by making heavy use of &lt;strong>separators&lt;/strong>. If you do not have a system of your own for sorting mods, you can use &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/recommended-mods/separators/">mine&lt;/a> for inspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="standard-procedure">Standard Procedure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In case it needs to be said:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read (or at least skim) the mod page for every mod you install. &lt;u>Check the Requirements tab.&lt;/u>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the comment section for pinned comments and read some of the newest comments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the bugs section.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Every time you add a new mod &lt;strong>determine if the mod does what you want it to do in a way that is sensible.&lt;/strong> You should have checked through &lt;u>every single mod&lt;/u> you install eventually. Look at the plugins in SSEEdit and the assets in Mod Organizer 2. Manage conflicts when they appear.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-management">Plugin Management&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is no exact rule on often you should hop into SSEEdit, but doing it every ten or so plugins can be helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you discover conflicts or potential consistency issues, remember to check the Nexus (including patch collections) for pre-existing patches. If none exists to solve your problem, you can either create it yourself, remove one of the mods, or ignore the problem if it is minor enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I highly recommend creating &lt;strong>small patches&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>ModGroups&lt;/strong> as you work through your load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
It is also possible to install the majority of your mods first before really diving into SSEEdit, sorting out your current list of plugins by adjusting the load order and creating patches, before adding to it more slowly. Do whatever works best for you.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="asset-management">Asset Management&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="ingame-testing">Ingame Testing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ingame testing is never sufficient to build a modded setup. You &lt;u>cannot&lt;/u> avoid SSEEdit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I highly recommend the occasional &lt;code>coc riverwood&lt;/code> to ensure that the game properly launches - if not, you should have a limited amount of possible culprits if you do it often enough which may speed up the troubleshooting process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ingame testing is crucial for building the visual overhaul of a setup. You will want to spend a good amount of time running around Skyrim to see if you like your current combination of mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, I recommend ingame testing as one of the last steps in building your setup, long after you have worked through SSEEdit. There are many issues that you will never notice in SSEEdit - mostly related to clipping objects or inconsistencies between mods - that you can best see in the actual game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="visual-baseline">Visual Baseline&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you care at all about visuals, I recommend creating a nice baseline before moving on to the core of your list. Your combination of weather + lighting overhauls with ENB or Community Shaders will determine the overhaul atmosphere and style of the visuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first decisions you will have to make are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Decide if you want parallax / complex materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide if you want to use ENB or Community Shaders.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="mod-organizer-2">Mod Organizer 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)&lt;/strong> is the only mod manager supported by this guide. You are expected to use it when following the instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-mo2">Why MO2?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your mod manager is the heart and soul of your setup. &lt;strong>The steps you go through in building that setup are often specific to the tool you choose.&lt;/strong> Vortex is used differently from Mod Organizer 2, particularly with regards to load and mod order management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this guide is intended to teach you the concepts of load order and mod order in general, it is also important to learn how maintaining and expanding your setup works in the practical sense. Accommodating multiple different mod managers would require many sections to be written twice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MO2 versus Vortex question is hotly debated in the community. In my &lt;em>personal opinion&lt;/em>, Vortex has come a long way but its approach to load and mod order management is critically flawed. In addition to that, many quality of life features that I use frequently in Mod Organizer 2 are missing altogether. This is why this guide is built around Mod Organizer 2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://users.nexusmods.com/register/memberships">Nexus Premium&lt;/a> is a paid subscription that grants certain perks to users, including removal of all ads and faster downloads. The Nexus has also added an additional click to the process of downloading a file which includes a countdown and an ad for the Premium membership to further incentivise purchasing a subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend holding off on Premium until you have progressed enough in your modding journey to know that you will stick with it for a while. When building a larger mod setup, paying for a month or so of Premium can be well worth the asking price. It is also a great way of giving back to the Nexus for their service, especially for those of us with ad blockers installed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Nexus Virus Check</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/nexus-virus-check/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/nexus-virus-check/</guid><description>
&lt;p>All files that are uploaded to the Nexus will automatically be checked for viruses by &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">VirusTotal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can view the report by clicking the &lt;strong>checkmark&lt;/strong> in front of the file name.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Files that exceed 250MB in size are manually verified. Occasionally, VirusTotal will detect &lt;em>false positives&lt;/em> which usually happens with tools (see Mod Organizer 2) in which case the file is also manually verified.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mod-organizer-2">Mod Organizer 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mod Organizer 2 has been known to set off Antivirus software, usually due to the way that the UVFS is implemented. At times, it may still be flagged by one of the AVs used by VirusTotal in which case it will be manually verified by the Nexus that it is safe to use.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This section covers &lt;u>my personal opinion&lt;/u> on the tool LOOT. The short version is that I think the tool is severely misunderstood by a significant part of the community, especially newcomers. You need to take its limitations into account if you want to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to understand what I am talking about a basic understanding of load order, plugins, and conflicts is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="loot-and-load-order">LOOT and Load Order&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, here is the thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Figuring out the ideal load order is hard, actually.&lt;/strong> It is time-consuming, especially for large load orders: For example, TPF has well over 1,000 plugins, and it is far from the biggest setup out there. I spend a lot of time, hours upon hours, in SSEEdit, looking at conflicts to figure out which are harmless, which can be resolved through load order adjustments, and which require patches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is thus unsurprising that efforts have been made to automate this process. The tool BOSS was made for sorting plugins in the Oblivion modding days; it has since been superseded by LOOT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on a user-created masterlist, LOOT attempts to sort your plugins in a way that minimises conflicts. This is inherently imperfect as it would be impossible to create a database accounting for every single mod and possible conflict.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
LOOT is capable of one thing: Solving load order conflicts &lt;u>if&lt;/u> the conflict in question is on the masterlist. LOOT cannot create patches or even discover conflicts by itself.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>That does not mean LOOT is bad, period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is bad is the widespread notion that modding = installing mods &amp;raquo; running LOOT &amp;raquo; playing the game.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can observe the result of this idea every day on the Skyrim modding subreddit, in Nexus comments, on various Discord servers. It is unfortunately reinforced by many mod authors who recommend running LOOT on their mod pages without clarifying that simply running LOOT does not a functional modded setup make. Plenty of &amp;ldquo;modding guides&amp;rdquo; further perpetuate this idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👏 &lt;strong>LOOT will not fix your load order.&lt;/strong> 👏&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, LOOT &lt;u>can&lt;/u> speed up the process of fixing your load order by improving your baseline. Some of the most talented mod authors and list curators I know are using LOOT with a multitude of custom rules to manage their load order and consider this the most efficient way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;font size=2>*I do want to stress that LOOT was never &lt;u>marketed&lt;/u> as this magical fix-all solution. It is the community hivemind that has portrayed it as such.*&lt;/font>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Porting SLE Mods</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/porting-sle-mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/porting-sle-mods/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="differences-by-file-type">Differences by File Type&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not all mods made for Skyrim LE will work out-of-the-box in Skyrim SE. A fair amount of them will need porting.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
A mod being available on the Skyrim SE Nexus does not automatically mean it was ported properly (or at all).
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugins:&lt;/strong> Must always be ported using the CK. Occasionally require manual updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Archives:&lt;/strong> Must always be unpacked or they will crash the game. Can be repacked afterwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SKSE Plugins:&lt;/strong> Must always be ported for the newest version of SKSE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meshes:&lt;/strong> Should be processed with SSE NIF Optimizer / Cathedral Assets Optimizer (though not always necessary).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Textures:&lt;/strong> Some older formats must be changed to avoid crashes. Compression recommended.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Animations:&lt;/strong> Should be processed with Cathedral Assets Optimizer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scripts:&lt;/strong> No porting steps required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="plugins">Plugins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Plugins created for Skyrim LE must always be ported. This requires the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/creation-kit/">Creation Kit&lt;/a> and sometimes &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/sseedit/">SSEEdit&lt;/a> for additional steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/porting-sle-plugins/">Porting SLE Plugins&lt;/a> page for instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="archives">Archives&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Archives (BSAs) created for Skyrim LE must always be extracted. They will otherwise crash Skyrim SE on launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please consult the article on &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/extracting-bsas/">Extracting BSAs&lt;/a> for instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="textures">Textures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Textures created for Skyrim LE sometimes need to be compressed or changed to a different format for Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since Skyrim SE, the engine supports the &lt;strong>BC7 compression format&lt;/strong> which combines the small file size of a compressed texture while retaining nearly the same quality as an uncompressed texture of an older format. Textures for Skyrim LE were sometimes left uncompressed for better visual quality, but should be compressed to BC7 for use in Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Only &lt;u>uncompressed&lt;/u> textures can be compressed to BC7. If a texture is already formatted as a DXT5/BC3, recompressing it to BC7 will not improve the quality or save any more space.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Textures can be processed with CAO for optimisation. Instructions can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="meshes">Meshes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Meshes created for Skyrim LE often need to be optimised for Skyrim SE. They may crash the game or cause visual issues otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use either &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/cao/">Cathedral Assets Optimizer&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/sse-nif-optimizer/">SSE NIF Optimizer&lt;/a> for optimising meshes. CAO includes NIFOpt though the latter still has some useful additional options that cannot be accessed through CAO (e.g., more detailed logs and removal of parallax).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions for processing with CAO can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="animations">Animations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Animations created for Skyrim LE need to be optimised for Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animations can be processed with CAO for optimisation. Instructions can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
You cannot port FNIS animations this way, only vanilla replacers.

&lt;p>Skyrim has been updated and re-released many times on many platforms since its initial launch in 2011. Significant differences exists between the available versions which affect modding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="skyrim-le--skyrim-se">Skyrim LE / Skyrim SE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two &amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo; versions of Skyrim:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim Legendary Edition (SLE)&lt;/strong> is the version originally released in 2011 and packaged with its three DLC (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim Special Edition (SSE)&lt;/strong> is a remaster released in 2016, also packaged with all DLC. One of its core features was a major engine upgrade.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The original Skyrim ran on a 32bit version of the &lt;em>Creation Engine&lt;/em> which limited the game to 4GB of RAM and generally made it more difficult to build a stable, modded setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was given the 64bit engine upgrade originally built for &lt;em>Fallout 4&lt;/em> which improved various rendering techniques for visual improvements but also increased stability. It is generally easier to mod Skyrim SE. However, certain kinds of SLE mod require to be &lt;strong>ported&lt;/strong> before they work properly in SSE and it took several years for the modding community to fully move on to the new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, most mods are being developed and released for SSE exclusively. The only reason to choose SLE over SSE is performance as it will run better on extremely low-end systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creation-club">Creation Club&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Creation Club was one of the main selling points for the Skyrim SE release. It is effectively a microtransaction store selling mini-DLC, some created by Bethesda developers, others by popular modders hired by Bethesda.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details, see &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/creation-club/">Creation Club&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="skyrim-ae">Skyrim AE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Skyrim Anniversary Edition (SAE) was released in 2021 and is often described as a third version of the game, after SLE and SSE. This is fundamentally incorrect. &lt;strong>Skyrim AE has no meaningful technical differences from SSE&lt;/strong> and is simply packaged with all Creation Club content. It is, in effect, a regular SSE update with some additional content.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
With the exception of mods that always need to be updated when the game updates (i.e., SKSE and SKSE plugins), mods do not need to be ported from SSE to SAE.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="storefronts">Storefronts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE is available from multiple sources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Steam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GOG&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XBOX Game Pass&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>SKSE is available for the &lt;strong>Steam&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>GOG&lt;/strong> versions, but &lt;u>not&lt;/u> for the &lt;strong>Game Pass&lt;/strong> version. However, because there is a separate version of SKSE, not all mods with SKSE plugins offer compatibility for the GOG version of Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Steam version of Skyrim SE is the best option for modding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="consoles">Consoles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The original Skyrim LE was also ported to &lt;strong>PlayStation 3&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX 360&lt;/strong>. These console versions were not moddable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was released for the next generation of consoles, &lt;strong>PlayStation 4&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX One&lt;/strong> in 2016 with a major difference being that on these platforms modding was made possible through the Bethesda.net infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE (as part of the Anniversary Edition) was ported to &lt;strong>PlayStation 5&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX Series X/S&lt;/strong> in 2021 and is moddable in the same way as in the previous generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was also ported to the &lt;strong>Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong> in 2017. Modding is possible in a limited fashion if custom firmware has been installed on the device which carries its own risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE can be modded on a &lt;strong>Steam Deck&lt;/strong>; however, there are some limitation due to the Deck running on Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
While technically possible, &lt;u>modding on PlayStation and XBOX is not comparable to modding on PC&lt;/u> due to the hard limit on space and the lack of access to the root folder which makes it impossible to use advanced mods/tools like SKSE and ENB.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="vr">VR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A VR version of Skyrim was released for Windows and PlayStation VR.
