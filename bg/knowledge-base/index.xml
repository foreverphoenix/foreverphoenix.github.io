&lt;h2 id="vanilla-ini-files">Vanilla INI Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Various settings for Skyrim can be configured in a set of INI files:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Skyrim.ini&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both can be found in the &lt;code>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These INI files were regenerated during the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/clean-install/">Clean Install&lt;/a> and a performance preset (low, medium, high, etc) was applied when opening the launcher for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also a &lt;code>SkyrimCustom.ini&lt;/code> which does not exist in vanilla but can be created in the same directory to overwrite the other two INIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
You can restore the set of vanilla INIs in the Documents folder by deleting them and launching the game through Steam. In the Launcher, you will be informed that the game will configure your settings (applying a preset) after which you can quit.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="valid-settings">Valid Settings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not all settings are valid in all INI files.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim.ini&lt;/strong> can modify all settings valid in the game &lt;u>except&lt;/u> those specific to the Launcher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SkyrimCustom.ini&lt;/strong> can modify all settings valid in the game &lt;u>except&lt;/u> those specific to the Launcher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/strong> can modify a limited range of settings (&lt;a href="https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:SkyrimPrefs_INI">documented here&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The catch is that duplicate INI settings are overwritten in the following order:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/strong> &amp;raquo; &lt;strong>SkyrimCustom.ini&lt;/strong> &amp;raquo; &lt;strong>Skyrim.ini&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
For example, if &lt;strong>bFXAAEnabled=&lt;/strong> is set to &lt;strong>1&lt;/strong> in the &lt;strong>Skyrim.ini&lt;/strong> and set to &lt;strong>0&lt;/strong> in the &lt;strong>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/strong>, the latter will overwrite and FXAA will be off (0) ingame.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-inis">Plugin INIs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>INIs can also be attached to &lt;strong>plugins&lt;/strong> (ESP, ESL, ESM). Similar to BSAs, they are loaded if they have the same name as the plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any setting that is &lt;u>not valid&lt;/u> in the &lt;strong>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/strong> can be added to a plugin INI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plugins that load INI files are displayed with a paper clip icon in the load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/knowledge-base/ini-files/plugin-with-ini.png" alt="Plugin with INI">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ini-files-and-mo2">INI Files and MO2&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="profile-specific-inis">Profile-Specific INIs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Going forward, I recommend not bothering at all with the default set of INIs, nor with the Settings in the launcher through which some of their lines can be modified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, make use of your &lt;u>profile-specific INIs&lt;/u> in Mod Organizer 2. Each profile in a MO2 instance can hold a unique set of INIs that will replace the default ones when the game is started with that profile selected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable profile-specific INI files, open the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/tool-setup/mo2/mo2-profiles-settings.png">profile settings&lt;/a> and ensure &lt;strong>Use profile-specific Game INI files&lt;/strong> is enabled. These INI files will be saved under &lt;code>\Mod Organizer 2\profiles\&amp;lt;your profile&amp;gt;\&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/bethini/">BethINI&lt;/a> is able to target profile-specific INIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
When &lt;em>copying&lt;/em> a profile in Mod Organizer 2, the profile-specific INI files will also be copied.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/knowledge-base/ini-files/mo2-profile-specific-inis.png" alt="Profile Specific INIs">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="modifying-inis-through-mo2">Modifying INIs through MO2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can view and edit all INI files through the INI Editor in Mod Organizer 2. It will display the profile-specific set if that option is enabled, and the default set from the Documents folder if it is not.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
When modifying INIs through the INI Editor always remember to click the &lt;strong>Save&lt;/strong> button at the bottom.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>I recommend customising the INI files using the tool &lt;strong>BethINI&lt;/strong>. You can find instructions &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/ini-config/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Mod Managers</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/mod-managers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/mod-managers/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="mod-organizer-2">Mod Organizer 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)&lt;/strong> is the only mod manager supported by this guide. You are expected to use it when following the instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-mo2">Why MO2?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your mod manager is the heart and soul of your setup. &lt;strong>The steps you go through in building that setup are often specific to the tool you choose.&lt;/strong> Vortex is used differently from Mod Organizer 2, particularly with regards to load and mod order management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this guide is intended to teach you the concepts of load order and mod order in general, it is also important to learn how maintaining and expanding your setup works in the practical sense. Accommodating multiple different mod managers would require many sections to be written twice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MO2 versus Vortex question is hotly debated in the community. In my &lt;em>personal opinion&lt;/em>, Vortex has come a long way but its approach to load and mod order management is critically flawed. In addition to that, many quality of life features that I use frequently in Mod Organizer 2 are missing altogether. This is why this guide is built around Mod Organizer 2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://users.nexusmods.com/register/memberships">Nexus Premium&lt;/a> is a paid subscription that grants certain perks to users, including removal of all ads and faster downloads. The Nexus has also added an additional click to the process of downloading a file which includes a countdown and an ad for the Premium membership to further incentivise purchasing a subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend holding off on Premium until you have progressed enough in your modding journey to know that you will stick with it for a while. When building a larger mod setup, paying for a month or so of Premium can be well worth the asking price. It is also a great way of giving back to the Nexus for their service, especially for those of us with ad blockers installed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Nexus Virus Check</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/nexus-virus-check/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/nexus-virus-check/</guid><description>
&lt;p>All files that are uploaded to the Nexus will automatically be checked for viruses by &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">VirusTotal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can view the report by clicking the &lt;strong>checkmark&lt;/strong> in front of the file name.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Files that exceed 250MB in size are manually verified. Occasionally, VirusTotal will detect &lt;em>false positives&lt;/em> which usually happens with tools (see Mod Organizer 2) in which case the file is also manually verified.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mod Organizer 2 has been known to set off Antivirus software, usually due to the way that the UVFS is implemented. At times, it may still be flagged by one of the AVs used by VirusTotal in which case it will be manually verified by the Nexus that it is safe to use.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This section covers &lt;u>my personal opinion&lt;/u> on the tool LOOT. The short version is that I think the tool is severely misunderstood by a significant part of the community, especially newcomers. You need to take its limitations into account if you want to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to understand what I am talking about a basic understanding of load order, plugins, and conflicts is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="loot-and-load-order">LOOT and Load Order&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, here is the thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Figuring out the ideal load order is hard, actually.&lt;/strong> It is time-consuming, especially for large load orders: For example, TPF has well over 1,000 plugins, and it is far from the biggest setup out there. I spend a lot of time, hours upon hours, in SSEEdit, looking at conflicts to figure out which are harmless, which can be resolved through load order adjustments, and which require patches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is thus unsurprising that efforts have been made to automate this process. The tool BOSS was made for sorting plugins in the Oblivion modding days; it has since been superseded by LOOT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on a user-created masterlist, LOOT attempts to sort your plugins in a way that minimises conflicts. This is inherently imperfect as it would be impossible to create a database accounting for every single mod and possible conflict.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
LOOT is capable of one thing: Solving load order conflicts &lt;u>if&lt;/u> the conflict in question is on the masterlist. LOOT cannot create patches or even discover conflicts by itself.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>That does not mean LOOT is bad, period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is bad is the widespread notion that modding = installing mods &amp;raquo; running LOOT &amp;raquo; playing the game.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can observe the result of this idea every day on the Skyrim modding subreddit, in Nexus comments, on various Discord servers. It is unfortunately reinforced by many mod authors who recommend running LOOT on their mod pages without clarifying that simply running LOOT does not a functional modded setup make. Plenty of &amp;ldquo;modding guides&amp;rdquo; further perpetuate this idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👏 &lt;strong>LOOT will not fix your load order.&lt;/strong> 👏&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, LOOT &lt;u>can&lt;/u> speed up the process of fixing your load order by improving your baseline. Some of the most talented mod authors and list curators I know are using LOOT with a multitude of custom rules to manage their load order and consider this the most efficient way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;font size=2>*I do want to stress that LOOT was never &lt;u>marketed&lt;/u> as this magical fix-all solution. It is the community hivemind that has portrayed it as such.*&lt;/font>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Porting SLE Mods</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/porting-sle-mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/porting-sle-mods/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="differences-by-file-type">Differences by File Type&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not all mods made for Skyrim LE will work out-of-the-box in Skyrim SE. A fair amount of them will need porting.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
A mod being available on the Skyrim SE Nexus does not automatically mean it was ported properly (or at all).
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugins:&lt;/strong> Must always be ported using the CK. Occasionally require manual updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Archives:&lt;/strong> Must always be unpacked or they will crash the game. Can be repacked afterwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SKSE Plugins:&lt;/strong> Must always be ported for the newest version of SKSE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meshes:&lt;/strong> Should be processed with SSE NIF Optimizer / Cathedral Assets Optimizer (though not always necessary).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Textures:&lt;/strong> Some older formats must be changed to avoid crashes. Compression recommended.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Animations:&lt;/strong> Should be processed with Cathedral Assets Optimizer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scripts:&lt;/strong> No porting steps required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="plugins">Plugins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Plugins created for Skyrim LE must always be ported. This requires the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/creation-kit/">Creation Kit&lt;/a> and sometimes &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/sseedit/">SSEEdit&lt;/a> for additional steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/porting-sle-plugins/">Porting SLE Plugins&lt;/a> page for instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="archives">Archives&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Archives (BSAs) created for Skyrim LE must always be extracted. They will otherwise crash Skyrim SE on launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please consult the article on &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/extracting-bsas/">Extracting BSAs&lt;/a> for instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="textures">Textures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Textures created for Skyrim LE sometimes need to be compressed or changed to a different format for Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since Skyrim SE, the engine supports the &lt;strong>BC7 compression format&lt;/strong> which combines the small file size of a compressed texture while retaining nearly the same quality as an uncompressed texture of an older format. Textures for Skyrim LE were sometimes left uncompressed for better visual quality, but should be compressed to BC7 for use in Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Only &lt;u>uncompressed&lt;/u> textures can be compressed to BC7. If a texture is already formatted as a DXT5/BC3, recompressing it to BC7 will not improve the quality or save any more space.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Textures can be processed with CAO for optimisation. Instructions can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="meshes">Meshes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Meshes created for Skyrim LE often need to be optimised for Skyrim SE. They may crash the game or cause visual issues otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use either &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/cao/">Cathedral Assets Optimizer&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/tool-setup/sse-nif-optimizer/">SSE NIF Optimizer&lt;/a> for optimising meshes. CAO includes NIFOpt though the latter still has some useful additional options that cannot be accessed through CAO (e.g., more detailed logs and removal of parallax).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions for processing with CAO can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="animations">Animations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Animations created for Skyrim LE need to be optimised for Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animations can be processed with CAO for optimisation. Instructions can be found &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/optimising-sle-assets/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
You cannot port FNIS animations this way, only vanilla replacers.

&lt;h2 id="resolution">Resolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Monitors display images by rendering millions of tiny square pixels. Rendering more pixels increases image sharpness but requires more hardware power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pixels are arranged on most modern consumer monitors in a 16:9 ratio with other ratios, such as 16:10, 21:9, or 32:9, being quite rare. 5:4 and 4:3 ratios are essentially deprecated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Common &lt;strong>16:9&lt;/strong> resolutions include 1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3440x2160. They may be abbreviated as 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Common &lt;strong>21:9&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>widescreen&lt;/strong> resolutions include 2560x1080 and 3440x1440.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The 3440x2160 pixels resolution is also commonly referred to as 4K which is currently the largest resolution used in gaming (with 8K still being very rare).
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="performance">Performance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Skyrim is known to scale badly at higher resolutions, especially when heavily modded. Running the game with overhauled graphics and an ENB preset at 1440p or higher resolutions requires high end hardware to run at a stable 60FPS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An easy boost to performance at the cost of sharpness is gained by running the game at a resolution that is &lt;em>lower&lt;/em> than the monitor&amp;rsquo;s native resolution. For example, if performance is very low on a 2160p monitor, you can try downscaling to 1440p. This can be done with &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/recommended-mods/essential-mods/#sse-display-tweaks">SSE Display Tweaks&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Downscaling will noticeably affect visual fidelity and other measures of performance optimisation should be taken first. When downscaling, you can counter the blurriness by using ENB or ReShade to add sharpening.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="interface">Interface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The vanilla interface and nearly all interface mods are made for the standard 16:9 ratio and will be cut off or misaligned on monitors with other ratios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778">Complete Widescreen Fix&lt;/a> mod page offers patches for vanilla, SkyUI, and a variety of mods. Other interface mods may offer widescreen patches separately. These are largely for 21:9 monitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="textures">Textures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is a common misconception that 4K textures (with a resolution of 4096x4096 pixels) are unnecessary on non-4K monitors. &lt;strong>This is false.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you view a 4096x4096 pixels &lt;em>flat image&lt;/em> on a 1440p screen you will indeed be unable to display all pixels at the same time. However, textures are not used as flat images in the game; they are wrapped around 3D objects called meshes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at a large mesh (like a part of a mountain) you only see a &lt;em>portion&lt;/em> of the texture that is applied to it. Depending on the size of the object and how closely you approach it, even a 4K texture can start to appear blurry on a 1080p monitor because you are zooming in on a very small part of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
4K textures on a 1080p or 1440p monitor are very much noticeable on large objects and not at all redundant.

&lt;p>Skyrim has been updated and re-released many times on many platforms since its initial launch in 2011. Significant differences exists between the available versions which affect modding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="skyrim-le--skyrim-se">Skyrim LE / Skyrim SE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two &amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo; versions of Skyrim:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim Legendary Edition (SLE)&lt;/strong> is the version originally released in 2011 and packaged with its three DLC (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim Special Edition (SSE)&lt;/strong> is a remaster released in 2016, also packaged with all DLC. One of its core features was a major engine upgrade.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The original Skyrim ran on a 32bit version of the &lt;em>Creation Engine&lt;/em> which limited the game to 4GB of RAM and generally made it more difficult to build a stable, modded setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was given the 64bit engine upgrade originally built for &lt;em>Fallout 4&lt;/em> which improved various rendering techniques for visual improvements but also increased stability. It is generally easier to mod Skyrim SE. However, certain kinds of SLE mod require to be &lt;strong>ported&lt;/strong> before they work properly in SSE and it took several years for the modding community to fully move on to the new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, most mods are being developed and released for SSE exclusively. The only reason to choose SLE over SSE is performance as it will run better on extremely low-end systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creation-club">Creation Club&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Creation Club was one of the main selling points for the Skyrim SE release. It is effectively a microtransaction store selling mini-DLC, some created by Bethesda developers, others by popular modders hired by Bethesda.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details, see &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/creation-club/">Creation Club&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="skyrim-ae">Skyrim AE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Skyrim Anniversary Edition (SAE) was released in 2021 and is often described as a third version of the game, after SLE and SSE. This is fundamentally incorrect. &lt;strong>Skyrim AE has no meaningful technical differences from SSE&lt;/strong> and is simply packaged with all Creation Club content. It is, in effect, a regular SSE update with some additional content.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
With the exception of mods that always need to be updated when the game updates (i.e., SKSE and SKSE plugins), mods do not need to be ported from SSE to SAE.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="storefronts">Storefronts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE is available from multiple sources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Steam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GOG&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XBOX Game Pass&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>SKSE is available for the &lt;strong>Steam&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>GOG&lt;/strong> versions, but &lt;u>not&lt;/u> for the &lt;strong>Game Pass&lt;/strong> version. However, because there is a separate version of SKSE, not all mods with SKSE plugins offer compatibility for the GOG version of Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Steam version of Skyrim SE is the best option for modding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="consoles">Consoles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The original Skyrim LE was also ported to &lt;strong>PlayStation 3&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX 360&lt;/strong>. These console versions were not moddable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was released for the next generation of consoles, &lt;strong>PlayStation 4&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX One&lt;/strong> in 2016 with a major difference being that on these platforms modding was made possible through the Bethesda.net infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE (as part of the Anniversary Edition) was ported to &lt;strong>PlayStation 5&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>XBOX Series X/S&lt;/strong> in 2021 and is moddable in the same way as in the previous generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE was also ported to the &lt;strong>Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong> in 2017. Modding is possible in a limited fashion if custom firmware has been installed on the device which carries its own risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skyrim SE can be modded on a &lt;strong>Steam Deck&lt;/strong>; however, there are some limitation due to the Deck running on Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
While technically possible, &lt;u>modding on PlayStation and XBOX is not comparable to modding on PC&lt;/u> due to the hard limit on space and the lack of access to the root folder which makes it impossible to use advanced mods/tools like SKSE and ENB.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="vr">VR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A VR version of Skyrim was released for Windows and PlayStation VR. Though based on Skyrim SE, it has various technical differences, requires its own version of SKSE, and is not always compatible with Skyrim SE mods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bg: Wabbajack</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/wabbajack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/wabbajack/</guid><description>
