&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Summary&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This step covers all aspects of preparing the vanilla game, including creations, for modding with Mod Organizer 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is the first step of the &lt;strong>Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide - Core Module&lt;/strong>. The Core Module is similar to a traditional guide in that it asks you to read closely and follow along with all its instructions as it takes you through the very basics of building a modded setup. It is aimed at complete newcomers to modding Skyrim.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="requirements">Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Core Module requires the &lt;strong>Steam&lt;/strong> version of &lt;strong>Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/strong>. Whether you own the &lt;strong>Anniversary Edition DLC&lt;/strong> is irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should have a file archiver like &lt;a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7ZIP&lt;/a> installed and I also recommend using &lt;a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++&lt;/a> for modifying config files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="file-name-extensions">File Name Extensions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Make sure that &lt;strong>file name extensions&lt;/strong> are set to visible in Windows Explorer. This will enable you to tell apart files by their extensions which is fairly important.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To see file name extensions, go into &lt;strong>Windows Explorer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the &lt;strong>View&lt;/strong> tab/ribbon, make sure the &lt;strong>File name extensions&lt;/strong> box is ticked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/file-name-extensions.png" alt="File Name Extensions">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clean-install">Clean Install&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Please start by performing a &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/clean-install/">Clean Install&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nexus-mods">Nexus Mods&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The vast majority of mods and tools (including Mod Organizer 2) are hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods&lt;/a>. The Nexus supports hundreds of games though it should come as no surprise that the six games with the most downloads in total (by a wide margin) are the most recent Bethesda games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will download many files from various Nexus pages throughout this guide and we will also talk about the site in general. In order to download mods, you must have an account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>If you do not have a &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods&lt;/a> account yet, go ahead and create one now.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="mod-manager-choice">Mod Manager Choice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Learning how to mod Skyrim SE is largely about learning how to use the various tools to your advantage. Now that we have returned Skyrim to a pristine vanilla state, we can move on to installing the most important tool in our tool box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)&lt;/strong> is a mod manager. Like its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334">Mod Organizer&lt;/a>, it is community-made and open-source, with a wide range of features catering specifically to advanced modders. If you are serious about building an extensive setup of mods, Mod Organizer 2 is going to be your best friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Using Mod Organizer 2 is &lt;u>mandatory&lt;/u> for this guide.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
You can check the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/mod-managers/">Mod Managers&lt;/a> article for more information about available mod managers and why I chose MO2.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Rather than list all the features of MO2 right now, I will slowly introduce them to you as we go. Many of its unique advantages would make very little sense to you before we have established some basic knowledge about modding in general. I will also gradually explain various elements of the UI as we go, so do not feel discouraged or overwhelmed when you first open the tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mod-organizer-2">Mod Organizer 2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Please follow all steps of the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/mo2-setup/">MO2 Setup&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ui-overview">UI Overview&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now you can get your first look at MO2. &lt;strong>If the interface seems daunting, do not feel discouraged!&lt;/strong> You will get used to it faster than you may think. Much of the UI simply makes a great deal of sense which is why it will quickly become easy to navigate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, we are not going to discuss the purpose of the various parts of MO2&amp;rsquo;s interface: Without context, the details would be difficult to memorise. For now, please have a look at the five primary components of the UI which I will refer to from now on by the names defined below.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(1) The toolbar&lt;/strong> allows you quick access to a number of sub menus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(2) The profile drop-down&lt;/strong> allows quick switching between MO2 profiles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(3) The executables drop-down&lt;/strong> is where you select and run executables like the game or a tool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(4) The left pane&lt;/strong> is the mod order. This is where all your mods will appear once installed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(5) The right pane&lt;/strong> contains various tabs like the Plugins tab for managing the load order.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
You will also see all Creation Club files that you own in MO2. They will be dealt with in the next step.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/mo2-ui-overview.png" alt="MO2 UI Overview">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creation-club">Creation Club&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Read the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/knowledge-base/creation-club/">Creation Club&lt;/a> article for more information.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Since the release of &lt;strong>Skyrim Anniversary Edition&lt;/strong>, everyone owns at least the following free creations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ccbgssse001-fish&lt;/strong> (Fishing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ccbgssse025-advdsgs&lt;/strong> (Saints &amp;amp; Seducers)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ccbgssse037-curios&lt;/strong> (Rare Curios)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ccqdrsse001-survivalmode&lt;/strong> (Survival Mode)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;u>These will always be installed alongside the game.&lt;/u>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you bought additional Creations, downloaded them when they were free, or bought the &lt;strong>Anniversary Edition DLC&lt;/strong>, they should have been downloaded upon launching the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
&lt;strong>Creations are official mods.&lt;/strong> We are going to organise them the same way we organise other mods, and for the same reasons.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Right now, the Creations are managed by Mod Organizer 2 just like the official DLC: They are always active and cannot be selectively disabled. Also, the names are verbose. We do not like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="managing-creations">Managing Creations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Please follow all steps in the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/managing-creations/">Managing Creations&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="free-creations">Free Creations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Enable the four free creations by checking the boxes in MO2:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Creation Club - Survival Mode&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creation Club - Fishing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creation Club - Saints &amp;amp; Seducers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creation Club - Rare Curios&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
If you own more creations, leave them disabled until after you have completed the Core Module.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="mo2-separators">MO2 Separators&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Among the most useful features in MO2 for organising your mod order are &lt;strong>separators&lt;/strong>. They were highly requested by the community and eventually implemented by the MO2 team. Each separator can be placed anywhere in the mod order, its name and colour can be customised, mods can be grouped below it, and they can be collapsed or expanded at will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, you can see a picture of my visuals-only setup&amp;rsquo;s mod order to get an idea of how separators can help with organising several hundreds of mods:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/aurora-mod-order.png" alt="Aurora mod order">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-separators">Creating Separators&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At the top of our current mod order (left pane), you can see the three DLCs. We can group them under a separator of their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Click the tools icon above the mod order and select &lt;strong>Create separator&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/mo2-create-separator.png" alt="Create Separator">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enter &lt;strong>Official Master Files&lt;/strong> as the name and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Your new separator will show up at the bottom of your mod order.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Drag it up above the three DLC in the right pane.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We can also add a separator for the creations.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Click the tools icon above the mod order and select &lt;strong>Create separator&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter &lt;strong>Creation Club&lt;/strong> as the name and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drag it up below the three DLC and above the creations in the right pane.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="separator-colours">Separator Colours&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you like you can also change the separator&amp;rsquo;s colour. You can do so by right-clicking it and clicking &lt;strong>Select Color&lt;/strong>. You can set the separator to any colour you like, it can be changed anytime, and every separator can have a different colour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your colour choices should roughly match your MO2 theme for optimal readability: For instance, my colour scheme would be far too bright for anyone using dark mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
If you are also using the default MO2 theme, I can recommend this nice blue &lt;strong>#A9D5FF&lt;/strong> which I am using for my separators here.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="collapsing-separators">Collapsing Separators&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Separators can be collapsed, hiding all the mods that were sorted underneath it. This is incredibly useful for large setups. &lt;strong>Double-click the Creation Club separator to collapse it&lt;/strong> - much better, right?&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Summary&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This step covers the differences between the root and data folder, the files that belong in each of them, and how those files can be managed with Mod Organizer 2. It also covers the installation of the Skyrim Script Extender.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>With the game freshly (re)installed and set up with Mod Organizer, we will now look at folder structures and how that affects mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The unmodded, pristine version of Skyrim that we restored previously is referred to as &lt;strong>Vanilla Skyrim&lt;/strong>. It is about 12.7GB in size (plus up to 5.8GB for Creations) and located in a Steam library directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="root-folder">Root Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Navigate to your Skyrim SE installation. The file path is &lt;code>\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
You can use &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/mo2-open-game-folder.png">this shortcut&lt;/a> in Mod Organizer 2 to quickly locate the folder.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is your &lt;strong>root folder&lt;/strong>. It contains the two executables: &lt;strong>SkyrimSE.exe&lt;/strong>, which directly opens the game, and &lt;strong>SkyrimSELauncher.exe&lt;/strong>, which starts the Launcher first. The latter is what Steam runs when you start the game through the Steam UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/skyrim-root-folder.png" alt="Root Folder">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-folder">Data Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>data folder&lt;/strong> is located inside the &lt;strong>root folder&lt;/strong>. Open it now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>data folder&lt;/strong> contains all game files which are split into &lt;strong>plugins (ESMs)&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>archives (BSAs)&lt;/strong>. There are five &lt;strong>ESMs&lt;/strong> containing all game data and 18 &lt;strong>BSAs&lt;/strong> containing all assets. They are used by the engine to build the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The five ESMs are also referred to as the &lt;strong>official master files&lt;/strong>.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/skyrim-data-folder.png" alt="Data Folder">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-folder-files">Data Folder Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The basic structure of mods is the same as the basic structure of the official game files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are &lt;strong>plugins&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>assets&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugins&lt;/strong> contain game data. They have the file extension &lt;strong>ESP&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>ESL&lt;/strong>, or &lt;strong>ESM&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Assets&lt;/strong> are loose files. There are many kinds of assets, including textures, meshes, scripts, and so on.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assets&lt;/strong> are often stored in &lt;strong>archives (BSAs)&lt;/strong>. You can think of BSAs as 7ZIP / WinRAR archives for Skyrim assets (textures, scripts, etc). They require a plugin of the same name in order to be loaded. All vanilla game BSAs are therefore loaded by &lt;strong>Skyrim.esm&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Mods that are structured like the vanilla game files always belong in the data folder.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/diagrams/basic-mod-structure.png" alt="Mod Structure">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mod-managers">Mod Managers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine this: You install 100 mods. Each of these mods consists of a different combination of plugins, archives, and loose files. You extract them all into the data folder. Many of them interact: They are patches or modifications for each other and therefore they contain some of the same files (as in: files with the same name). As you install these mods, they overwrite each other in the order of installation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you want to update or remove a mod. Oh, no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless you remember exactly which files belong to that mod and unless they never interacted with files from another mod, you now have a veritable situation on your hands. Fun issues that may ensue include &amp;ldquo;purple&amp;rdquo; objects or broken mechanics due to overwritten or missing assets. It is virtually impossible to build a functioning setup of even moderate dimensions in this fashion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is why we use mod managers to manage data folder files. &lt;strong>Mod Organizer 2&lt;/strong> is particularly good at this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mo2s-virtual-file-system">MO2&amp;rsquo;s Virtual File System&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The developer of Mod Organizer 2, Tannin, came up with a clever way of avoiding data folder spaghetti: When you install a mod through MO2 it is extracted into its own folder rather than into the data folder. This way, files from different mods never clash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the resulting folder structure:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>\Mod Organizer 2\mods\Mod 1\&amp;lt;files from mod 1&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>\Mod Organizer 2\mods\Mod 2\&amp;lt;files from mod 2&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>\Mod Organizer 2\mods\Mod 3\&amp;lt;files from mod 3&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When you launch any application (a modding tool or the game itself) through Mod Organizer 2, it builds a &lt;strong>virtual data folder&lt;/strong> from the files in the separate folders at runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
&lt;strong>This creates the concept of a mod order:&lt;/strong> All mods remain separate from each other. You will never lose track of files and any conflicts between mods (when they contain files of the same name) are visualised in Mod Organizer 2. You then review these files and decide which file should win the conflict by changing the order of the mods or selectively hiding/removing files.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>And that is why Mod Organizer 2 is going to be your best friend. Cherish it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="viewing-the-data-folder">Viewing the Data Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can check your virtual data folder in the &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong> tab in the right pane in MO2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below you can see your &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> data folder on the left (no creations, just vanilla files). On the right you can see your &lt;em>virtual&lt;/em> data folder as previewed by MO2 which &lt;em>does&lt;/em> include the creations as they are currently being managed by MO2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/virtual-data-folder.png" alt="VDF">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="root-folder-files">Root Folder Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mod Organizer 2 exists to manage the contents of the &lt;strong>data folder&lt;/strong> which contains the vanilla game files and which is also where the vast majority of mods belong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What about the &lt;strong>root folder&lt;/strong>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;u>Mods that do not belong into the data folder are rare.&lt;/u> They typically hook into the game&amp;rsquo;s engine in some way which is why they must be located in the same directory as the game&amp;rsquo;s executables, that is, the root folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Standard procedure involves managing &lt;strong>data folder mods&lt;/strong> with a mod manager and dropping &lt;strong>root folder mods&lt;/strong> directly into the root folder. This works fine because there are far fewer root folder mods and they clash very rarely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, there is an alternative that I strongly prefer and recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="root-builder">Root Builder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;strong>Root Builder&lt;/strong>, a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which enables it to manage root folder mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(You can think of MO2 plugins as mods for MO2. Yes, we are modding the mod manager.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are the advantages of Root Builder?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can manage &lt;u>all mods&lt;/u> in Mod Organizer 2, keeping your Skyrim installation 100% clean and vanilla.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>This means your setup is completely self-contained and can exist alongside any number of other modlists.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can use MO2 functionality for version number tracking, custom notes, conflict management, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can use MO2 as an ENB / ReShade manager, switching between presets painlessly while retaining modifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Making &lt;strong>Root Builder&lt;/strong> optional is not currently feasible for this guide. While the plugin is not perfect, I believe that its benefits more than outweight the minor issues it sometimes causes.
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Please refer to the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/root-builder/#installation">Root Builder&lt;/a> module for installation instructions.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="skyrim-script-extender">Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With &lt;strong>Root Builder&lt;/strong> in place, we can install what is arguably the most important mod of all: The &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> (SKSE).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Please refer to the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/skyrim-script-extender/">Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/a> module for more details and installation instructions.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="meta-files">Meta Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When downloading mods from the Nexus, a &lt;strong>.meta&lt;/strong> file with various information about the mod will be downloaded alongside it and data from this meta file, like the mod&amp;rsquo;s URL, Nexus category, and version number, will be automatically extracted from the meta file when installing the mod through MO2. Some of this data is then displayed in the MO2 UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meta file will also automatically reflect the installation status of the mod in the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> pane. Currently, the downloaded MO2 plugins and SKSE are listed as &amp;ldquo;Downloaded&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;Installed&amp;rdquo; because we installed them manually. Address Library is properly marked as &amp;ldquo;Installed&amp;rdquo; because we &lt;em>did&lt;/em> install it through the UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(After uninstalling a mod, its archive will be listed as &amp;ldquo;Uninstalled&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> tab.)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;strong>The following instructions are optional.&lt;/strong> You can absolutely ignore this feature and skip ahead to &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/core-module/step3/">Step 3&lt;/a> as it is purely cosmetic.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I personally update my metas &lt;em>religiously&lt;/em> to keep track of which mods I have yet to install or update and which archives can be removed. The larger your setup the more important it is to be diligent in keeping MO2 clean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, I will mark the manually installed mods as &amp;ldquo;Installed&amp;rdquo; by modifying their meta files.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Right-click the &lt;strong>Curation Club&lt;/strong> archive in your &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> tab and select &lt;strong>Open Meta File&lt;/strong>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>You may have to choose an app. I recommend setting &lt;strong>Notepad++&lt;/strong> as the default.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change &lt;strong>installed&lt;/strong> from &lt;strong>false&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>true&lt;/strong> near the bottom of the file.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Here you can also see the other data saved in the meta files, including version number, description, link, and more.
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Save your change and close the file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat the process for the &lt;strong>Root Builder&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> meta files.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Order has been restored.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="version-number">Version Number&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since we did not install the &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> through Mod Organizer 2, it did not import any data from the meta file. I do, however, like to use MO2 to keep track of version numbers and updates, so I am filling in the required data manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Double-click &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> in your mod order.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch to the &lt;strong>Nexus Info&lt;/strong> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>Mod ID&lt;/strong> enter &lt;strong>30379&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can find the ID for SKSE (and any other Nexus mod) in the respective URL (&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/find-mod-id.png">reference picture&lt;/a>). This will allow Mod Organizer 2 to track the mod page and notify you about updates as well as enable the option to right-click the mod and quickly open the Nexus page.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>Version&lt;/strong> enter the current version, i.e. &lt;strong>2.2.3&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After you close the window again, the version number will appear properly in the &lt;strong>Versions&lt;/strong> column in the MO2 UI like it will for all mods that you install in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Summary&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This step covers the basic architecture of Bethesda plugins and how they can be modified.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="unofficial-skyrim-special-edition-patch">Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will start by installing an example mod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/strong> (USSEP) is an ambitious project aiming to squash the various bugs and inconsistencies never addressed by Bethesda. It is probably the single most popular Skyrim mod in existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The USSEP is not without controversy. Many of its changes have been criticised for being out-of-scope which is rarely received well by the somewhat eccentric project lead. Nevertheless, I highly recommend the mod, especially to newcomers, because it does fix a lot and because not using it limits your options where other mods are concerned.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="new-separator">New Separator&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, we will add a new separator:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/mo2-create-separator.png">Create a new separator&lt;/a> in MO2 and name it &lt;strong>Essential Mods&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave it at the bottom of the left pane, below &lt;strong>Address Library for SKSE Plugins&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="ussep-installation">USSEP Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now go ahead and grab the latest version from the Nexus:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download and install the &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=files">Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The USSEP requires the four free creations which is why earlier instructions ensured they were installed and activated.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="plugins--load-order">Plugins &amp;amp; Load Order&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Plugins&lt;/strong> contain a variety of game data. For example, they determine an NPC&amp;rsquo;s hairstyle, where the NPC is placed in the game world, what it holds in its inventory, and much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After enabling the USSEP, a new plugin will appear in the &lt;strong>Plugins&lt;/strong> tab in the right pane which is also called the &lt;strong>load order&lt;/strong>. Currently, the USSEP is at the bottom of the load order. All other files above are greyed out because they are official game files (vanilla and creations) because their load order position are hardcoded and cannot be changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>By adding one plugin as a &lt;strong>master&lt;/strong> to another plugin, you can modify its contents. However, the dependent plugin will now require its master to function. All plugins require at least &lt;strong>Skyrim.esm&lt;/strong> because most game data is defined in that plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Because all mods require one or more of the five vanilla ESMs they are known as the &lt;strong>official master files&lt;/strong>.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>You can view a plugin&amp;rsquo;s masters by hovering over it in the MO2 UI:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-masters.png" alt="USSEP Masters">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a master is missing, MO2 will promptly warn you. Uncheck one of the four free creations in the mod order to trigger the warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
A missing master is always a &lt;strong>critical issue&lt;/strong> and must be fixed.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>(Remember to re-enable the creation.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-missing-masters.png" alt="USSEP Missing Masters">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sseedit">SSEEdit&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to understand how plugins are structured, why they are dependent on their masters, and why missing masters are such a big deal, we need to have a proper look at their inner workings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While plugins can also be created and edited in Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s official modding tool, the &lt;strong>Creation Kit&lt;/strong>, the community-made &lt;strong>SSEEdit&lt;/strong> is much better suited for beginners to get an idea of how plugins are structured and how load order works.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
SSEEdit does not replace the Creation Kit, nor does the Creation Kit replace SSEEdit. The tool to use always depends on the type of plugin you are working on and what you are trying to do. For example, for the vast majority of tweaks, edits, and patches, SSEEdit is the way to go because it is very good at visualising conflicts and interactions.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Please refer to the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/bg/additional-modules/sseedit-setup/">SSEEdit Setup&lt;/a> module for installation instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-unwanted-effects-book">The Unwanted Effects Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Equipped with SSEEdit and an example mod, we can now take a look at a practical example demonstrating how plugins are structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter the &lt;strong>Unwanted Effects Book&lt;/strong>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among vanilla Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s colourful assortment of bugs are certain active effects, applied by spells for instance, that may get &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; on the player after they are supposed to expire. The &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/strong> fixes these effects, but it also adds an option for the player to rid themselves of any leftovers. Initially, this fix could be accessed through a shrine in the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, but was later moved to a book added to the player&amp;rsquo;s inventory upon loading the game. Following complaints about a lack of immersion, a compromise was finally reached by placing the book in the Temple of Kynareth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using books or powers in order to access or customise a mod&amp;rsquo;s functionality was rather common before the Script Extender and SkyUI came along, although nowadays such options have largely been moved to dedicated mod configuration menus. With the release of Skyrim SE and the introduction of mods on consoles, many mod authors had to revert to these old workarounds as it is impossible to install files outside the data folder on consoles, and thus impossible to install the Skyrim Script Extender. The USSEP team does not want to move the option to an MCM or make it available only through the (in-game) console as that would not work for the XBOX and Playstation ports of the mod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, for us PC players, the book is mostly redundant. If you ever find yourself stuck with an active effect, you can get the book through the console very easily, so there is no need to have it lying around in the game world or lugging it around with you. Does it really break immersion? Some players are vehemently opposed to having any sort mod config items in the world. Others probably never noticed the book in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Either way, disabling that book makes for a nice example edit, our first foray into the world of plugins.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-informative-console">More Informative Console&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When trying to locate and identify an item in the game, &lt;strong>More Informative Console&lt;/strong> is invaluable. It expands the console interface (which we already briefly looked at after installing SKSE) with a variety of helpful features that come in handy in the process of building a modded setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download and install &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250?tab=files">More Informative Console&lt;/a>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Pay attention and make sure to grab the correct version.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Activate the mod in your mod order.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="finding-the-book">Finding the Book&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go and have a look at that book, shall we?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Select &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> from the MO2 executables drop-down and click &lt;strong>Run&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the main menu, open the &lt;strong>console&lt;/strong> (press the &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/tilde.jpg">tilde key&lt;/a> above TAB on your keyboard).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Type &lt;code>coc WhiterunTempleOfKynareth&lt;/code> and press &lt;strong>Enter&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>coc&lt;/code> (center on cell) command is incredibly useful for testing. When used from the main menu, it will create a test character in your chosen cell with some basic equipment (check your inventory if you like).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
&lt;strong>The coc command should be used for testing only.&lt;/strong> You will run into all kinds of issues if you try to use it for an actual playthrough as skipping the intro this way will cause many of the game&amp;rsquo;s (and mods&amp;rsquo;) scripts to never be properly initialised.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>To find the book, go from where you spawned by the entrance to the temple into the sleeping area on the right. There is a bookcase just in front of you with the &lt;strong>USSEP Unwanted Effects Remover&lt;/strong> on the floor leaning against its side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-1.jpg" alt="USSEP Book 1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-2.jpg" alt="USSEP Book 2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we know where the book is. How does that help us?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The USSEP plugin is big. It contains hundreds upon hundreds of records, and finding a single book among them sounds rather tedious. What you need is the book&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>Form ID&lt;/strong>, its unique identification number. To figure out that &lt;strong>Form ID&lt;/strong>, we installed &lt;strong>More Informative Console&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Open the console once again and click on the book.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is what you should see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-3.png" alt="USSEP Book 3">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything we could possibly need to know we can see at a glance thanks to the mod. Either take a screenshot (or simply refer to mine), then &lt;strong>save&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>close&lt;/strong> the game. It is time to talk about &lt;strong>Form IDs&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Yes, a warning popped up in MO2. We will deal with it in due time.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="form-ids">Form IDs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every object, NPC, magic effect, music track, etc, in the game is defined in a unique &lt;strong>record&lt;/strong> which is contained in a &lt;strong>plugin&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
For vanilla Skyrim, that is what the &lt;strong>official master files&lt;/strong> do: Each of the five plugins contains thousands of records, one for every &lt;em>thing&lt;/em> in the game: NPCs, magic effects, music tracks, and so forth.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Every record has a unique Form ID to be identified by. No two Form IDs can ever be identical.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Form IDs consist of 8 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal&lt;/a> numbers (1-9 and A-F), for example &lt;code>070B1985&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two denote the &lt;strong>Index&lt;/strong> which refers to the load order position of the plugin that the record was initially defined in. They change depending on your load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remaining six numbers will always stay the same. This is why there can never be two plugins with duplicate Form IDs: No two plugins can be loaded in the same spot in the load order which means they will &lt;u>always&lt;/u> have a different index.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Unless they are ESLs which all load in slot 254, or FE. But we will get to that later.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="base-and-ref-form-id">Base and Ref Form ID&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>However, if we check the info we grabbed through More Informative Console, we will notice that the book has not one but &lt;em>two&lt;/em> Form IDs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-formid.png" alt="USSEP Book FormID">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s up with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Base Form ID&lt;/strong> is &lt;code>070B1985&lt;/code> and describes the book itself: It defines which model it uses, what its contents are, and, in this case, what script is attached to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the first two digits of the &lt;strong>Form ID&lt;/strong>, the &lt;strong>Index&lt;/strong>, you can tell that it is defined in the &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong> plugin. If you check the load order in Mod Organizer 2, the mod index of the USSEP plugin is &lt;code>07&lt;/code> which is identical to the index of the book&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>Base Form ID&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-plugin-index.png" alt="USSEP Plugin Index">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Ref Form ID&lt;/strong> is &lt;code>0190001B&lt;/code> and describes the book&amp;rsquo;s placement: That it is located in the &lt;code>WhiterunTempleofKynareth&lt;/code> cell, that it is enabled, how it is placed, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason a second Form ID is needed is because you may have copies of the same object distributed throughout the game. While the book is unique right now, a Steel Sword would not be. There are dozens of hand-placed Steel Swords in Skyrim. Each of them has a unique REFR (reference) record with its unique Ref Form ID: They refer to the original item defined in the record with the Base Form ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Because there are so many REFR records, SSEEdit is caching them to speed up its initial processing of records (RefCache).
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="injected-records">Injected Records&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As you may have noticed, the &lt;strong>Index&lt;/strong> for the book&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>Ref Form ID&lt;/strong> &lt;code>01&lt;/code> actually corresponds to &lt;strong>Update.esm&lt;/strong> instead of the USSEP plugin: It is an &lt;strong>injected record&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that while the reference does not originate in Update.esm, another plugin modifying it would not have a missing master if the USSEP were not present as long as Update.esm was there. This is helpful for patchless compatibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a mod might change the interior of the Temple of Kynareth in such a way that the USSEP book is suddenly stuck in furniture, or otherwise inaccessible or in the way. The mod author could add the USSEP as a master to their plugin and move the book out of the way, but now their Temple of Kynareth mod would always require the USSEP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, because the REFR record is an injected form, they could copy it into their own plugin and disable it. Record &lt;code>0190001B&lt;/code> is injected into Update.esm, and &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> has Update.esm; hence, there would be no additional requirements. If the USSEP was present, the book would be removed. If the USSEP was not present, nothing would happen and there would be no errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Moving the book instead of disabling would not be possible because the base record is not an injected form and cannot be referenced without adding the USSEP as a hard requirement. It would have to be replaced with a dummy item.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Injected records are inherently risky because, unlike with “normal” records, it is possible for duplicates to be present which can cause significant issues. Mod authors will only use injected records if there is no other way to ensure easy compatibility. &lt;a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Injected_Record_Registry">There is an (incomplete) list keeping track of them.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="records--layers">Records &amp;amp; Layers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Armed with all this theoretical knowledge on forms and records, we should fire up SSEEdit.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Click the &lt;strong>SSEEdit&lt;/strong> icon in your toolbar to quickly launch it through MO2.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the changelog pops up, check &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t show again until changed&lt;/strong> and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the dev message appears, check &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t show again for a while&lt;/strong> and click &lt;strong>Close&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the background, MO2 will be locked now. This will always happen when you launch tools through its interface to prevent you from changing anything in the virtual data folder while that is used by another tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;strong>SSEEdit&lt;/strong>, you will see your &lt;strong>load order&lt;/strong> (&amp;ldquo;Module Selection&amp;rdquo;). All plugins should be checked by default, so go ahead and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSEEdit will begin loading up your plugins which should not take too long since we already generated refcache for the official master files. You can follow the tool&amp;rsquo;s progress in the log. While SSEEdit loads your plugins, it will display random tips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once it is done, SSEEdit will ask you about activating &lt;strong>ModGroups&lt;/strong>. This is because the USSEP comes with a ModGroup file that was now recognised by the tool. We will talk about ModGroups later; for now, leave the USSEP ModGroup disabled and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SSEEdit log should now return &lt;code>Background Loader: finished&lt;/code>, so we can proceed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sseedit-left-pane">SSEEdit Left Pane&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the left pane of SSEEdit, you can see your list of plugins, the load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Double-click the &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong> to expand it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The USSEP is &lt;em>huge&lt;/em>. You will immediately see a long list of record types unfolding, each of which contains dozens if not hundreds of individual records.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Double-click the &lt;strong>Book&lt;/strong> category to expand it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select the first record in the list, &lt;code>[00019514] DB07Journal &amp;quot;Cicero’s Journal - Final Volume&amp;quot;&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-details.png" alt="USSEP Book Details">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the index &lt;code>00&lt;/code> we can tell that the record originates in &lt;strong>Skyrim.esm&lt;/strong>. We can see the book&amp;rsquo;s full Form ID in the first column in the left pane of SSEEdit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second column is the &lt;strong>EditorID&lt;/strong> (EDID) which is &lt;code>DB07Journal&lt;/code>. This is another way to refer to a record (which is also used in scripts sometimes). Almost all records contain references to other records which consist of their EditorID, their Signature (the record category they belong to), and their Form ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third column displays the &lt;strong>Name&lt;/strong> of the record, i.e., &lt;code>Cicero’s Journal - Final Volume&lt;/code>, which is also the name you will see ingame. Not all records have names. Names are also not unique. They are easier to understand, but not always useful for identifying a record.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-columns-left.png" alt="xEdit">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="layers--priority">Layers &amp;amp; Priority&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the right pane now which displays more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, both the right pane side and the record name in the left pane are highlighted in green. &lt;strong>Green means that the original record is overwritten by one or more plugins &lt;em>without&lt;/em> creating critical conflicts.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the original record as defined by Skyrim.esm in the first column, then the USSEP version in the second column. These columns correspond to the plugins and are sorted in the order of the plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Each of these columns can be thought of as a &lt;strong>layer&lt;/strong>. Each layer completely overwrites the earlier ones.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Imagine placing a stack of papers on your desk: You can only read the one on the top. Similarly, the Skyrim engine can only read the final layer that covers up the ones underneath. Here, the USSEP overwrites Skyrim.esm. You could now change anything you wanted in the Skyrim.esm layer; as long as the USSEP overwrote it, you would not see a change ingame.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Plugins overwrite each other in the order they are loaded in. Skyrim will only read the final plugin.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Later on, with a larger load order, you may have multiple plugins overwriting a single record. Each of them may make a different change, but the engine will only read the one at the bottom of the load order and completely ignore the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is why patching is so important: It means consolidating all desired changes in one final layer.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual change in our current example record is in the &lt;strong>Book Text&lt;/strong> which is conveniently highlighted in green in the USSEP column. You can double-click it to compare the changes with the original.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-changes.png" alt="Book Changes">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="disabling-the-ussep-book">Disabling the USSEP Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can easily find the book that we want to disable by searching for its unique Form ID:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the &lt;strong>Form ID&lt;/strong> search box above the load order, enter the book&amp;rsquo;s base ID &lt;code>070B1985&lt;/code> and press &lt;strong>Enter&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-search-formid.png" alt="Search FormID">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will notice that, unlike the other book records, this one is displayed in white (highlighted blue in my screenshot because it is currently selected). &lt;strong>White records are records that are not overwritten:&lt;/strong> The book was newly added by the USSEP, it was defined in its plugin, and no other plugin affects it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Mod authors frequently prefix their &lt;strong>EditorIDs&lt;/strong> with their name or the mod name. This makes them easier to find.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So what are we going to do with the book?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theoretically we could simply right-click and delete the book&amp;rsquo;s base record. However, the reference record placing the book in the Temple of Kynareth links back to the book&amp;rsquo;s base record and would throw an error if the base record it references was deleted. These kinds of errors can cause crashes and other issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-error.png" alt="Book Error">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, it is much better to leave the base record in place and disable the REFR record.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-the-refr">Finding the REFR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One way to find the REFR record would be to search for the Ref Form ID like we did before. However, there is another way of quickly tracking down referenced records:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>With the &lt;strong>USSEPUnwantedEffectsRemoverBook&lt;/strong> record selected, click the &lt;strong>Referenced By (1)&lt;/strong> tab at the bottom of the right pane.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double-click the one REFR record listed here to immediately switch to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/find-refr-records.png" alt="Find REFR">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There we go. Under the blue highlight (because it is currently selected), the record in the left pane has no coloured background (meaning it is new and not overwritten) and in &lt;em>italics&lt;/em> (meaning it is injected):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-ref.png" alt="Find REFR">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under &lt;strong>NAME - Base&lt;/strong> in the right pane, you can see the full name of the book record (consisting of EDID, Name, Signature, and BaseID). If you scroll further down, there is the &lt;strong>DATA - Position/Rotation&lt;/strong> section which defines the book&amp;rsquo;s exact placement. This would best be edited in the Creation Kit where you have a visual preview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various other parameters are greyed out because they are unused.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-a-new-layer">Creating a new layer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While it is entirely possible to edit the REFR record directly, it would mean that you would have to do it all over again whenever the USSEP updated. For any edit like this (and later on for patches) I highly recommend creating new plugins instead of directly editing the mod(s) in question. It is also much easier to keep track of custom changes if they are in separate plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Right-click the &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong> column in the right pane.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &lt;strong>Copy as override into &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong> to copy the layer into another plugin.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-create-layer.png" alt="Create Layer">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-warning-window.png">warning window&lt;/a> that now appears will always show up the first time you edit anything in an SSEEdit session. It can be turned off and I recommend doing that eventually.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
When making changes, it is important to know that &lt;strong>there is no &amp;ldquo;Undo&amp;rdquo; button in SSEEdit&lt;/strong>. If you make a mistake, you need to restore the previous state manually or close without saving your changes and start over. It is possible to save manually during a longer session.
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Click &lt;strong>Yes I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely sure&lt;/strong> to acknowledge the warning and proceed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A new window will pop up with various different plugins that the record can be copied into.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the &lt;strong>&amp;lt;new file&amp;gt;.esp&lt;/strong> option and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book&lt;/strong> as the name of the new plugin and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong> once more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-new-plugin.png" alt="New Plugin">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new plugin was created and will appear at the bottom of the plugin list in the left pane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scroll down and expand its &lt;strong>Cell&lt;/strong> records until you find the REFR record added by the USSEP. As you can see it is highlighted in green since the original record was overwritten now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-itm.png" alt="Book ITM">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="identical-to-master">Identical to Master&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the new plugin, the font colour is grey instead of purple. &lt;strong>That means the record is an ITM, or Identical to Master.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The master for the REFR record is &lt;strong>Update.esm&lt;/strong> (because it is an injected form) and the master for the book referenced in the REFR record is the USSEP (because the book record originates in the USSEP). For that reason, both the USSEP and Update.esm are required. Skyrim.esm is also added as a master to any new plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the full list of masters if you click on &lt;strong>File Header&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-masters.png" alt="Book ITM">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because nothing has (yet) been changed in the new layer, it is still &lt;em>identical to all its masters&lt;/em> and therefore an &lt;strong>ITM&lt;/strong>. ITMs are often (but not always) unnecessary and potentially disruptive (because they can override and negate other mods&amp;rsquo; changes) which is why they usually merit further investigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This particular record will, of course, be modified.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="adding-a-record-flag">Adding a record flag&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In order to disable the book ingame, we can use a &lt;strong>Record Flag&lt;/strong>. Scroll up to the top of the record in the right pane to find the &lt;strong>Record Flags&lt;/strong> line which is currently empty.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Right-click the empty space next to &lt;strong>Record Flags&lt;/strong> and select &lt;strong>Edit&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/sseedit-add-record-flag.png" alt="Add Record Flag">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new window will pop up with a list of options that you can check. Near the top of that list is a &lt;strong>Delete&lt;/strong> option which is not the one you should choose. Flagging records as deleted will cause crashes if they are referenced by other records and it is considered best practice to always use the &lt;strong>Initially Disabled&lt;/strong> flag instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;strong>Initially Disabled&lt;/strong> means a record can potentially be re-enabled by a script later on. For example, certain coffins are flagged as initially disabled. If an NPC dies, their coffin in the Hall of the Dead of their home city will be enabled and thus become visible to the player.
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Check the box for &lt;strong>Initially Disabled&lt;/strong> and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/initially-disabled-flag.png" alt="Disable Flag">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saving-your-changes">Saving your changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Saving changes made in SSEEdit is a slightly unintuitive process: You actually have to &lt;em>close&lt;/em> the tool to be prompted to save what you changed (unless you save manually).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Close &lt;strong>SSEEdit&lt;/strong> (click the red X in the upper right corner).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A window with all plugins edited in that session will pop up. Only the &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong> should be listed here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure that the new plugin we created is checked and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-overwrite">The Overwrite&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whenever a file is generated by a tool that is run through Mod Organizer 2, it will &amp;lsquo;catch&amp;rsquo; these files in a folder called the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. That, as it happens, is where our new plugin ended up, and it is why &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/overwrite-warning.png">a warning popped up in MO2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> is located at the bottom of the mod folder which means its contents will &lt;u>always&lt;/u> overwrite the rest of the mod order (hence the name). Because it always overwrites, the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> should &lt;u>never&lt;/u> be more than a temporary location that is cleaned up as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The actual location of the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> accessible through the MO2 UI is &lt;code>\Mod Organizer 2\overwrite\&lt;/code>.
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Double-click the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> at the bottom of your mod order to open it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/overwrite-contents.png" alt="Overwrite Contents">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="managing-overwrite-files">Managing Overwrite Files&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since we only have a single file in the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, we can very easily convert its content into a new mod:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Close the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> window again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right-click the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Overwrite&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> and select &lt;strong>Create Mod&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Name it &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book&lt;/strong> and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move your new mod directly below the &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch&lt;/strong> and activate it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/overwrite-create-mod.png" alt="Overwrite Contents">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingame-test">Ingame Test&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we have created our first plugin tweak and cleaned everything up, it is time to jump in-game again to check if the plugin works as intended.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Launch the &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong> through Mod Organizer 2.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &lt;strong>Continue&lt;/strong> in the main menu to load your previously created save.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And &amp;hellip; gone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/ussep-book-removed.jpg" alt="Overwrite Contents">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You may wonder why we went through the process of digging through SSEEdit to disable a completely inconsequential feature before we even talked about load order and plugin types.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This step was never about the book.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With everything we learned about plugins, dependencies, and layers, &lt;strong>load order&lt;/strong> should be more than a theoretical concept now. It is a tangible thing that you have seen in action. You looked at records and edits, you created your own overwriting layer to make a change, and you saw the in-game effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we discuss plugin types and load order in the next step, these concepts will hopefully make more sense with the knowledge on plugin structure that we have now gained.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Summary&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This step covers&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="plugin-types">Plugin Types&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You may have noticed that we have plugins with three different extensions in our load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Skyrim.&lt;strong>esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ccBGSSSE037-Curios.&lt;strong>esl&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.&lt;strong>esp&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;strong>ESP&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>ESM&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>ESL&lt;/strong> files are Bethesda plugins. They share the same basic structure of records with Form IDs arranged in layers and overwrite each other according to their load order.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>There are, however, notable differences between them which we will discuss in this step.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="esp-and-esm-plugins">ESP and ESM Plugins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Plugins&lt;/strong> (ESP) like our previously created &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong> are the most common type of plugin. If you create a mod in the Creation Kit, it will be exported in this format and most plugin-based mods use a simple ESP. In the load order in MO2 they will appear without any text decoration (like bold or italic).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Master&lt;/strong> plugins (ESM) appear in &lt;em>&lt;strong>bold italics&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> in Mod Organizer 2 - see, for example, the official master files. They will always load above ESPs and therefore ESPs will always overwrite them in case of conflicts. If you try to swap the load order of the USSEP and our modification for it in MO2 you will notice that you cannot place an ESP above an ESM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-limit">Plugin Limit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The total number of ESM and ESP plugins in your load order cannot exceed 256 plugins.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is due to the hexadecimal system used to define them: Each plugin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>Index&lt;/strong> (the first two characters in their form ID) is made up of a combination of two numbers and letters which in turn is based on their load order. The hexadecimal system has 16 unique characters and there are exactly 256 possible combinations for two characters from 00 to FF (see table below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hexadecimal &lt;strong>FF&lt;/strong> is the decimal &lt;strong>255&lt;/strong>, so the maximum amount of plugins from 0 (00) to 255 (FF) is 256.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/hexadecimalchart.png" alt="Hexadecimal Chart">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Skyrim LE the plugin limit could be overcome by merging the records of multiple plugins into a single one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Skyrim SE plugin merging has become redundant for all but the largest of load orders thanks to the new ESL format of plugins introduced with the 2016 engine update.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="esl-plugins">ESL Plugins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Light&lt;/strong> plugins (ESL) were initially added for the Creation Club (Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE) and they were a game-changer for the modding scene because the plugin limit for ESLs is about ten times that as for ESPs and ESMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All ESL plugins have the index &lt;code>FE:xxx&lt;/code>. The hexadecimal FE is the decimal 254, so &lt;strong>all ESL plugins load in plugin slot 254.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is possible because their index was extended to the third, fourth, and fifth character in their eight character form ID: An ESL&amp;rsquo;s index could be &lt;code>FE:000&lt;/code> or &lt;code>FE:08F&lt;/code>. Thus, &lt;strong>the limit for ESLs is a whopping 4096 plugins&lt;/strong> - which is why we no longer need to merge plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-capacity">Plugin Capacity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The downside of ESLs is that they can store fewer records.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember that each record must have a unique Form ID. ESLs only have three digits left for a combination of the 16 hexadecimal characters whereas ESPs and ESMs have six digits. This means every ESL can only store 4096 unique Form IDs of which the first 2048 are reserved by the engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remaining 2048 slots are still more than enough for small- to medium-size mods. Many separate ESL plugins are infinitely easier to handle than a few big plugin merges (imagine having many small drawers for screws of different types and sizes instead of dumping all of them into a single big drawer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, this limit only affects &lt;u>new&lt;/u> records, i.e., records defined in the ESL plugin. There is no limit on how many records defined in &lt;em>other&lt;/em> plugins an ESL can hold. Many mods, especially patches, function mostly by editing existing (vanilla or mod-added) records and adding few or no new records of their own. These types of plugins are especially suited to being ESL-ified.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong> You can install up to &lt;u>4096&lt;/u> ESL plugins which can contain up to &lt;u>2048&lt;/u> new Form IDs each.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="plugin-flags">Plugin Flags&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We learned that &lt;strong>ESM&lt;/strong> plugins are distinguished in the load order by being displayed in &lt;em>&lt;strong>bold italics&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But here is something strange: The &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong> is displayed in &lt;em>&lt;strong>bold italics&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> in our MO2 load order tab when it actually has the ESP file extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, is it an ESM or an ESP? Actually, it is both. This is where &lt;strong>Plugin Flags&lt;/strong> come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Plugins can either be a full ESP, ESL, or ESM, &lt;strong>OR&lt;/strong> they can be any combination of the three.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>That sounds a little confusing, so let&amp;rsquo;s break it down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="esm-esl">ESM-ESL&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine you created a mod that is a resource to be used by other mods: It just contains a few keywords, maybe a dozen records. You can easily use the ESL format for this plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, your resource is also a &lt;strong>master&lt;/strong> to various dependent plugins which should be lower in the mod order, so preferably your plugin should load very early. It therefore makes sense to flag it as an ESM to automatically place it in the ESM space at the top of the load order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is an &lt;strong>ESM-ESL&lt;/strong> which will show up as &lt;em>&lt;strong>Example.esl&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> in the load order - like &lt;em>&lt;strong>ccBGSSSE037-Curios.esl&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="esm-esp">ESM-ESP&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now imagine your example mod is definitely one that should load very early to be overwritten by other mods but you have far too many original Form IDs to use the ESL format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that case, you can either opt for a full ESM or an ESP that is flagged as an ESM, that is, an &lt;strong>ESM-ESP&lt;/strong> - like the &lt;em>&lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
To my knowledge, there is no functional difference between a regular ESM and an ESM-ESP.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="esp-esl">ESP-ESL&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Finally, you may have a plugin that is just fine to load in ESP space because it is not intended as a sort of baseline or framework. If it does not contain many new Form IDs, you can usually flag the plugin as an ESL, turning it into an &lt;strong>ESP-ESL&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>ESP-FE&lt;/strong> (because ESLs always have an Index beginning with FE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which plugins can be flagged as ESL and how this can be done will be discussed in the following steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-an-esl">Creating an ESL&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Should you ever find yourself reaching the ESP/ESM plugin limit, you will no longer be able to launch the game - try to avoid that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can track your plugins via the neat little counter above your load order (hover for details):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/plugin-counter.png" alt="Plugin Counter">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With 9 plugins currently counting toward the 256 hard limit, we are in no danger of breaking the game anytime soon. Then again, load orders have the tendency to balloon to obscene dimensions so it is tends to be a good idea to ESL-ify as many plugins as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Plugins with few or no original records, like patches that mostly modify other mods, are best suited to the ESL format.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Hey, that sounds like our &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong> which only modifies a single reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Load up your load order in SSEEdit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-header">Plugin Header&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Plugin Type is determined by file extension and plugin flags. You can see the file extension in the left pane and plugin flag(s) in the &lt;strong>Plugin Header&lt;/strong> which is what you see when you select a plugin in SSEEdit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, you can see the &lt;strong>Plugin Header&lt;/strong> of our &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong>. It is a bog-standard ESP, so there are no plugin flags (or Record Flags as they are called here).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/esp-plugin-header.png" alt="ESP Plugin Header">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you select the &lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong>, you will see that it is flagged as an &lt;strong>ESM&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two of the CC plugins, &lt;strong>ccBGSSSE037-Curios.esl&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>ccQDRSSE001-SurvivalMode.esl&lt;/strong>, are additionally flagged as &lt;strong>ESLs&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="esl-flagging">ESL-Flagging&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Going back to our &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong>, we can now simply turn it into an ESL (that is, an ESP-ESL because it still has the ESP file extension) by adding the flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the &lt;strong>Plugin Header&lt;/strong>, right-click the empty space under &lt;strong>Record Flags&lt;/strong> and select &lt;strong>Edit&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Confirm when the warning window pops up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the box for &lt;strong>ESL&lt;/strong> and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Close SSEEdit. Make sure &lt;strong>Disable USSEP Book.esp&lt;/strong> is checked and click &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/esl-flag-plugin.png" alt="ESL Flag">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in MO2, our plugin now appears in &lt;em>italics&lt;/em> in the load order and the little yellow icon 🟡 that appeared in the &lt;strong>Flags&lt;/strong> column for the plugin confirms that it is ESL-flagged. You can also check this by hovering over it. And, of course, you can see the &lt;strong>FE&lt;/strong> index.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/bg/core-module/esl-flag-mo2.png" alt="ESL Flag">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="esm-space-and-references">ESM Space and References&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A major differences between plugins in ESM and ESP space is how references are handled.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Full ESLs load in ESM space, that is, they are forced to the top of the load order.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="persistent-vs-temporary">Persistent vs Temporary&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are two types of references:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Temporary references&lt;/strong> only load into memory when the player is close by and are unloaded when they are no longer needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Persistent references&lt;/strong> are always loaded into memory upon launching the game, regardless of player proximity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
