&lt;p>&lt;em>What if Skyrim was released a bit later?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/">&lt;strong>The Phoenix Flavour&lt;/strong> (&lt;em>TPF&lt;/em>)&lt;/a> for Skyrim Special Edition is a visuals and gameplay-focused modlist made by Phoenix. It includes hundreds of mods across several dozen categories, all carefully selected to fit Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s vision of a lore-friendly, improved but not radically changed Skyrim. The Phoenix Flavour strives to provide a solid upgrade of the vanilla experience with modern visuals and rebalanced gameplay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition&lt;/strong> (&lt;em>TPF DE&lt;/em> or &lt;em>DE&lt;/em>) is a fork of The Phoenix Flavour. It expands Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s world and possibilities extensively by adding adventuristic content for many tastes and beautiful sceneries surrounding it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Not intrusive, interesting new mechanics;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many useful tools and quality of life additions;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unique looks for all races of Skyrim;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh, hand-picked animations for player character;&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="recommended-hardware">Recommended Hardware&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Overall modded Skyrim is highly GPU-dependent. A fast card with plenty of VRAM will considerably improve performance. Installing the game on an SSD will improve load times dramatically and prevent stutter.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CPU:&lt;/strong> Processor with high single core performance (3.2GHz or more);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>RAM:&lt;/strong> 8-16 GB of DDR3 or DDR4 memory, running at 2400MHz or faster;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>GPU:&lt;/strong> A modern card with at least 6 GB of VRAM;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hard Drive:&lt;/strong> At least 170 GB of free space on your SSD, at least 100 GB - on your HDD.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Overall Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition needs a bit more resources than its parent, but at the same time not as much as the most popular modlists for high-end PCs&amp;rsquo; users. Everything from modern mid-end PC to high-end PC should run the modlist well without any problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Widescreen and controller support is included.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="about-wabbajack-and-the-list">About Wabbajack and the list&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wabbajack allows you to install my modpack to your PC by duplicating my setup directly to your PC, including each mod, setting, output etc.
If you want to better understand the general idea of Wabbajack, refer to a Reddit article
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/mbfk5f/what_wabbajack_is_and_why_you_should_care/">&lt;em>What Wabbajack is and Why You Should Care&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would very strongly recommend to check &lt;a href="introduction.md">&lt;em>Introduction&lt;/em>&lt;/a> to learn more about the list and &lt;a href="faq.md">&lt;em>Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/em>&lt;/a> to get answers to the most popular questions asked about the list.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning&lt;/strong>: Reading this guide is required for the modlist to work as intended. It will not work correctly if you do not get acquainted and follow all the instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="requirements">Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The latest version of Windows 10 or 11;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022">The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable - Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 X64&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The latest version of Skyrim Special Edition - 1.6.640 with &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Upgrade&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A free &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods&lt;/a> account, Premium is recommended.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning&lt;/strong>: The Anniversary Upgrade isn&amp;rsquo;t optional. Without it the modlist just won&amp;rsquo;t install for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="steam-setup">Steam Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you have successfully used any other official Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim Special Edition recently and if it uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Keeping-The-Game-Folder-Clean-(via-local-game-installs)">Game Stock folder system&lt;/a>, which allows us to leave Skyrim completely untouched and this way more compatible with other modpacks, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do the steps in this section and should continue with &lt;a href="#anniversary-upgrade">&lt;em>Anniversary Upgrade&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="steam-library-should-be-outside-windows-related-folders">Steam Library Should Be Outside Windows Related Folders&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The best location would be &lt;em>C:\Steam&lt;/em>. Such location is also called &lt;em>the root of the drive&lt;/em>. It can also be located in somewhere like &lt;em>C:\Games\Steam&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have your Steam library inside Windows related folder such as &lt;em>Desktop, Program Files, Downloads, Documents, OneDrive&lt;/em> etc.,
use a guide from &lt;a href="https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide">here&lt;/a> to put it outside of one of these folders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="start-with-clean-skyrim">Start with Clean Skyrim&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the &lt;em>Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/em> folder inside &lt;em>Documents/My Games/&lt;/em> by deleting the contents inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="set-the-games-language-to-english">Set the Game&amp;rsquo;s Language to English&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Right click on your &lt;em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/em> game, select &lt;em>Properties&lt;/em>, navigate to the &lt;em>LANGUAGE&lt;/em> tab and select &lt;em>English&lt;/em> from the dropdown menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="change-games-update-behaviour">Change Game&amp;rsquo;s Update Behaviour&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Head over to the &lt;em>Properties&lt;/em> again, navigate to the &lt;em>UPDATES&lt;/em> tab and change &lt;em>AUTOMATIC UPDATES&lt;/em> parameter to &lt;em>Only update this game when I launch it&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="start-skyrim-at-least-once">Start Skyrim at Least Once&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Start the game from Steam and and let it do the initial graphics check. Do not worry about this part as the installation will replace this graphics settings. Start the game and exit once you&amp;rsquo;re in the main menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="anniversary-upgrade">Anniversary Upgrade&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you have successfully used Anniversary Update&amp;rsquo;s Creation Club&amp;rsquo;s (CC) mods for Skyrim Special Edition recently by yourself or by using any other official Wabbajack modlist, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to follow the next steps in this section and must continue with &lt;a href="#installation">&lt;em>Installation&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that already, buy Anniversary Upgrade and make sure that Steam installed it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bethesda account, make it at &lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard">Bethesda.net&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Launch Skyrim through Steam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the &lt;em>Play&lt;/em> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>Creation Club&lt;/em> option.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Login with your Bethesda.net credentials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the &lt;em>Download All&lt;/em> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for Skyrim to finish.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed Wabbajack yet, grab its latest release from &lt;a href="https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases">here&lt;/a>, make a folder inside the root of the drive like &lt;em>C:\Wabbajack&lt;/em> and place the &lt;em>Wabbajack.exe&lt;/em> file inside it. This folder must not be in the Windows related folders
(&lt;em>Desktop, Program Files, Downloads, Documents, OneDrive&lt;/em> etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downloading and installation process can take a very long time, it depends on your system&amp;rsquo;s specifications, your internet&amp;rsquo;s speed and if you have Nexus Premium membership.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It will be way faster if you have one big mod folder for all modlists to make the installation process faster and not to make you download the mods once again
if you have them already.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Open &lt;em>Wabbajack.exe&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on &lt;em>Browse Modlists&lt;/em> and download &lt;em>The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition&lt;/em> from the gallery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the download is done, set the installation location again somewhere outside Windows related folders like &lt;em>C:\Skyrim SE Modlists\TPF DE&lt;/em> or &lt;em>C:\TPF DE&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Point Wabbajack towards your download location. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t downloaded any mods before, make a folder like &lt;em>D:\Skyrim SE Mods&lt;/em> or &lt;em>D:\Skyrim\Mods&lt;/em> and
then point Wabbajack to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the &lt;em>Play&lt;/em> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for Wabbajack to finish.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="problems-with-wabbajack">Problems with Wabbajack&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Sometimes Wabbajack can fail your installation for different reasons. At first, I recommend rerunning Wabbajack. Wabbajack will continue, where it left off, so you won&amp;rsquo;t need to reinstall anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="unable-to-download-skyrim-files">Unable to download Skyrim files&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Close Wabbajack. Verify the integrity of your game files through Steam by following these &lt;a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB">instructions&lt;/a>. Then rerun Wabbajack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="unable-to-download-mods">Unable to download mods&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some mods, which are not hosted on Nexus, or big sized mods tend to fail from time to time. Close Wabbajack and then just download them manually and put in your downloads folder, after that rerun Wabbajack. Usually those are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://mega.nz/#!qgcAAaYR!mHmS5Rkylq-XiOUVQOFQOPfXTFYn55lmF0BdLWLaKWk">High Poly Fern Meshes&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15_0njBUjHKidNnJPmLXEygzGVWsA3Zbq">High Poly Head&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973?tab=files">Terrain LOD, DynDOLOD outputs&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There can be other files, which unfortunately can&amp;rsquo;t be got in the same way. Try ticking the &lt;em>Network Workaround&lt;/em> option in Wabbajack&amp;rsquo;s settings, accessed by clicking on the gear symbol in the top right. If that does not resolve the issue, try using a VPN service. If the above does not work, try setting your download threads to 1 in the same settings of Wabbajack and try again. If it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you may need to wait a bit as that can mean there is a big amount of users trying to download the same things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you still have problems with Wabbajack, ask for help in &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm">TPF Discord server&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;em>#tpf-de-wabbajack-support&lt;/em> channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To get to the channel, simply find &lt;em>#role-settings&lt;/em> channel in the server and choose my role, new channels then will appear in the server&amp;rsquo;s list.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You will need to upload your log file to the corresponding channel for me and others to better understand the problem.
You can find the relevant file (&lt;em>Wabbajack.current.log&lt;/em>) inside the &lt;em>logs&lt;/em> folder within the latest version folder - this will be in the same location you saved &lt;em>Wabbajack.exe&lt;/em> to.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="configurations">Configurations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now open the folder, where you have saved the modpack, and double-click on &lt;em>ModOrganizer.exe&lt;/em> file. You can see the full setup - the mod order is on the left, sorted below separators that may be collapsed by default, and the load order with all plugins on the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default your game is capped at 60 FPS (to avoid any issues related to Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s physics) and is borderless. Your resolution was automatically detected and changed by Wabbajack.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you want to uncap your framerate (that is on you), do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>ESSENTIAL MODS&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click on &lt;em>SSE Display Tweaks&lt;/em> mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>INI files&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>SKSE\Plugins\SSEDisplayTweaks.ini&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line 204, change &lt;em>FramerateLimit&lt;/em> parameter to your desired framerate after &lt;em>=&lt;/em> sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>Save&lt;/em> button or use &lt;code>Ctrl&lt;/code> + &lt;code>S&lt;/code> shortcut.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you want to downscale your resolution, do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>ESSENTIAL MODS&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click on &lt;em>SSE Display Tweaks&lt;/em> mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>INI files&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>SKSE\Plugins\SSEDisplayTweaks.ini&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line 58, change &lt;em>BorderlessUpscale&lt;/em> parameter to &lt;code>True&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line 66, remove &lt;em>#&lt;/em> sign before &lt;em>Resolution&lt;/em> parameter and then write down your monitor&amp;rsquo;s native resolution after &lt;em>=&lt;/em> sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An optional step for those, who seek even more performance:&lt;/strong> In line 67, remove &lt;em>#&lt;/em> sign before &lt;em>ResolutionScale&lt;/em> parameter and then write down your desired resolution scale after &lt;em>=&lt;/em> sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would recommend to try 0.9 at first as resolution scale below 0.9 can look a bit too blurry depending on your resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol start="9">
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>Save&lt;/em> button or use &lt;code>Ctrl&lt;/code> + &lt;code>S&lt;/code> shortcut.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you want to change your field of view (FOV), do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>ESSENTIAL MODS&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click on &lt;em>Autorun&lt;/em> mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>Text files&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make a new line in the document.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add &lt;code>fov XX&lt;/code> to the line without any additional spaces.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change &lt;em>XX&lt;/em> to your desired field of view.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>Save&lt;/em> button or use &lt;code>Ctrl&lt;/code> + &lt;code>S&lt;/code> shortcut.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Some of the mods inside Mod Organizer are disabled by default in the modpack. Some of these are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>xLODGen Resource - SSE Terrain Tamriel&lt;/em>, because it is needed to be activated only when I generate terrain LODs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Blade and Bunt - Vanilla Difficulty Modifiers&lt;/em> under TPF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS&lt;/em> separator, because it makes the game easier and less interesting. If you find the combat of the game too difficult even after tweaking the game&amp;rsquo;s difficulty, you are free to enable the mod by clicking on a rectangle right next to its name on the left side of MO2, but then you will also need to put its plugin right next after Blade and Blunt&amp;rsquo;s plugin &lt;em>BladeandBlunt.esp&lt;/em> on the right side of MO2 by simply dragging it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here are also two already enabled modifiers for our dragon overhauling mod &lt;em>Dragon War&lt;/em>, which greatly improves dragons by actually making them to be treated with cautiousness. In the original mod dragons have too much health, so it becomes a little bit too annoying to fight them and that&amp;rsquo;s where these patches come handy nerfing their health and just a bit - their damage. If you want much longer fights with dragons, feel free to disable these two.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All the mods under &lt;em>WIDESCREEN SUPPORT&lt;/em> separator, because obviously only a few have those huge monitors. If you are actually one of them, enable the mods under this section and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Finally we are ready to open and finish configuring the game. Above the load order (in the right pane), you can see the executables drop-down. Very likely &lt;em>The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition&lt;/em> was already selected here, so you can start the game by clicking &lt;em>Run&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="in-game-adjustments">In-Game Adjustments&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And now we are ready to jump into the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some character presets available for your walkthrough. To use them, choose &lt;em>Presets&lt;/em> option in the top right side of the character creation menu,
then press &lt;code>F9&lt;/code> button to load available presets and then choose the desired one according to the race and the gender you have chosen for the character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to make your character on your own, at first we need to activate our character&amp;rsquo;s high poly head (much more detailed head than the vanilla one,
which you can also shape in much more ways) in character creation menu and then our hair, brows (and/or scars, beard) will look excellent on us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p align="center">
&lt;img width="50%" src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/tpf-de/face-part.png" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then customize your character to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content (while being reasonable). Hair with physics for women are obtainable by choosing hair with &lt;em>KSHairdosSMP.esp&lt;/em> near their name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://thephoenixflavour.com/Pictures/tpf-de/hdt-smp-hair.png" alt="image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use hair with physics for men, you will find instructions on how to get them a bit later. For better results with those, equip bald hair style now.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>After you get control over movements of your character, donâ€™t go anywhere right away.
It will be awesome if you wait for a pop-up about finishing things setting up to appear before doing anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then after talking with Ralof or Hadvar another pop-up will appear, which allows to allocate 35 skill points to whatever skill trees your character is going to use during their adventure (5 points per step, max 10 points in one tree). When you have chosen a tree, which you would like to put your points into by pressing &lt;code>Enter&lt;/code> or just clicking on it, then press &lt;code>Tab&lt;/code> to continue allocating points. After spending all the points, you will see that &lt;em>COMPLETE&lt;/em> option is chosen by default, so just press &lt;code>Tab&lt;/code> button once again to finish the allocation. Next you will be able to allocate 60 points for your base health, magicka and stamina in the same manner (10 points per step, max 130 points for one attribute).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you can turn on the following mods to decide if you would want to use them. They affect just the visual side of the game.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t a fan, just press the same button once again to turn them off.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Look What You See&lt;/strong> - Press your &lt;code>V&lt;/code> key to toggle headtracking in the third person view.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved Camera&lt;/strong> - Use your &lt;code>F&lt;/code> key to toggle between the first and the third person view.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Toggle Compass Hotkey&lt;/strong> - Tap &lt;code>X&lt;/code> key to toggle visibility of your compass.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equipment Toggle&lt;/strong> - Press &lt;code>Arrow Down&lt;/code> button to toggle your headgear&amp;rsquo;s visibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Some quick tips before the end:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>About the option to remove your tail&lt;/strong> - It is weird, but you will actually need to equip another tail to get rid from&amp;hellip; them both. To get the tail, open your inventory and in misc item section find an item called &lt;em>AddItemMenu&lt;/em> and click on it. Another menu with 4 items will pop up. Grab an item with a search option. Then open your inventory and use the item with the search option. Type &lt;code>tail&lt;/code> in AddItemMenu&amp;rsquo;s searcher. Choose the mod&amp;rsquo;s plugin and grab your tail. Then equip it like gear and your tail will be gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>About hair with physics for men&lt;/strong> - You will need to use AddItemMenu again, but this time type the word &lt;code>hair&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>About ENB&lt;/strong> - &lt;code>F10&lt;/code> button toggles the ENB effect, &lt;code>F11&lt;/code> opens the ENB GUI, &lt;code>F7&lt;/code> toggles an FPS counter. Feel free to make screenshots with Steam by using &lt;code>F12&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If the ENB isn&amp;rsquo;t for you and you want to change it, delete modpack&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>enbseries&lt;/em> folder and &lt;em>enbseries.ini&lt;/em> file from the fork&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Stock Game&lt;/em> folder first. You do not need to replace &lt;em>enblocal.ini&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>About friendly fire&lt;/strong> - You will do no damage to neutral and friendly NPCs by default. Press &lt;code>O&lt;/code> (letter) to toggle friendly fire. If you disable friendly fire, allies will still tolerate you if you hit them, but mainly during combat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>About fast travelling&lt;/strong> - By default fast travel is disabled, because it becomes much more interesting that way (you travel and discover much more) and there are plenty of ways to travel around - as in vanilla (horses, carriages, boats), paragliding, spells and another mean, which is tied to a quest (don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil that). If you still aren&amp;rsquo;t sold, feel free to reenable it by disabling &lt;em>Disable Fast Travel SKSE - No Janky Map UI&lt;/em> mod under the &lt;em>INTERFACE EXTENDED&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning&lt;/strong>: Very important information!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em> in the Bannered Mare can be activated &lt;strong>only&lt;/strong> after 5 in-game days after you have finished the main quest &lt;em>Unbound&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also a reminder that the modlist uses a mod called &lt;em>End Times&lt;/em>, which will &lt;strong>end the game&lt;/strong> if don&amp;rsquo;t finish the main quest line in &lt;strong>14 real life days, that means 336 real life hours&lt;/strong>. That should be enough to do many other things in between saving the world for the first time.
And don&amp;rsquo;t worry - &lt;strong>the game won&amp;rsquo;t end if you finish the main quest&lt;/strong>. You can always enter into MCM again to see how much time you have left. Be sure to remember.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thank-you">Thank You&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it! You are ready for the action.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This guide highlights major gameplay mods included in The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition, while also giving you some pointers on how to start your new adventures.
I have tried to write as little information as I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil the content for you, but it is hard to do, so you have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="alternative-start-and-ending">Alternative Start and Ending&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Right in the beginning of the game you can pick one of our character presets, which were made by me and some other list users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14553">&lt;em>Ralof or Hadvar&lt;/em>&lt;/a> allows us to skip the carriage drive and enter right into Helgenâ€™s Keep with Ralof or Hadvar.
In some way it isn&amp;rsquo;t an alternative start, but at the same time it is. What matters is this modâ€™s simplicity, which allows us to jump right into the action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25630">&lt;em>Choose Your Starting Skills&lt;/em>&lt;/a> makes it easier for us to define our character&amp;rsquo;s strong sides right at the beginning of the game by allocating our skill points and base stats according to what we are going to use the most (magic, hand to hand combat etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39201">&lt;em>End Times&lt;/em>&lt;/a> adds a bit of spice and action to the game as it will simply end it (immersively) if you don&amp;rsquo;t finish the game&amp;rsquo;s main quest line in 14 real life days, that means 336 real life hours. That should be enough to do many other things in between saving the world for the first time. There are many reasonings for it - for you to stop ignoring the main quest and so you can get some of the new quests which are locked behind the main quest line. Also consistence, because sooner or later there will be mentions of you being Dragonborn. Then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense gameplay wise to ignore it, especially considering the fact that now Alduin is a real threat to the world. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry - the game won&amp;rsquo;t end if you finish the main quest. You can always enter into the mod&amp;rsquo;s MCM to see how much time you have left if you have forgotten about it. Be sure to remember.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gameplay-overhauls">Gameplay Overhauls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Overall:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Levelling is slower than in vanilla, but you receive more perk points as you level up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combat is more difficult than in vanilla, but feels more fair.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like in vanilla, you are limited to one follower at a time (if we don&amp;rsquo;t count followers with their own unique AI like Inigo and Lucien).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want to go deeper, The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Edition includes several Simon Magus and DeltaRider&amp;rsquo;s overhauls to core gameplay system, which greatly improve the experience, but at the same time stay as close to their origins as possible:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686">Aetherius - A Race Overhaul&lt;/a> - Overhauls all racial powers to passive abilities (if we don&amp;rsquo;t count khajiit, who still have access to Night Eye, but have their own passive ability too), which fit their respective races well while being useful through all time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487">Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul&lt;/a> - Tiers dungeons according to enemy types to provide a sense of progression, so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you decide to run onto vampires right in the beginning of the game and turn into a snack. Also levels enemies according to your level for you not to stumble upon the first level NPC, while being high level, while giving you some more higher level enemies to fight too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549">Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul&lt;/a> - Adjusts the difficulty modifiers, slightly increasing incoming damage, while also capping elemental resistances to 75%, while also making it harder to stack too much armour. With those changes, combat will feel noticeably more difficult than vanilla to the point where you may be one-shot by certain enemy types. Stamina now also plays an important role in any fight as if you or your enemy run out of it, you will move and attack slower while being much more easy to be hit. Gives you an opportunity to think about when to strike, because if you or your enemy strikes when the other one power attacks, draws a bow or casts a spell, be ready to take or make a good chunk of damage. Also if you are playing with a one handed weapon, the mod allows you to parry by blocking with a weapon, what doubles your block effectiveness for one second. Targets who attack you during this window suffer a light stagger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191">Adamant - A Perk Overhaul&lt;/a> - Some key features include spells and perks that finally scale and remain strong options in the late game, shouts that will also scale in strength based on your Speech level and advance your Speech skill, removal of Arcane Blacksmith perk and its availability for payer right from the beginning, splitting the smithing perk tree into a crafting and a tempering branch
and perks that activate when wearing a full set of heavy or light armor work with only three pieces worn (no need for a helmet).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790">Hand To Hand - An Adamant Addon&lt;/a> - Merges Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single skill and adds a new perk tree for Hand to Hand combat. Merging Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single tree improves thief gameplay by reducing the number of non-combat skills that players need to invest in. It also creates space to add a new, fully integrated perk tree for Hand to Hand. This allows for full support for unarmed combat as a legitimate and competitive gameplay style, while also untethering unarmed from either light or heavy armor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411">Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul&lt;/a> - Greater powers given by some of the stones have been removed in favour of passive abilities that will define and support various builds. The more powerful stones often have downsides, in order to give you a choice between building around these downsides in exchange for powerful buffs or avoiding these downsides in exchange for more modest buffs. Additionally, Guardian Stones no longer provide experience bonuses, which often encouraged players not to trade them out for more interesting gameplay bonuses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130">Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul&lt;/a> - Significantly reduces the gold value of both player-created potions and generic potions while ensuring that the player still levels at a faster rate than vanilla. In addition, the mod rebalances generic potions so that their strongest and weakest variants match the potency of player-created potions. Finally, it removes several useless or poorly implemented effects in order to make room for more interesting new effects without adding new ingredients.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138">Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul&lt;/a> - Now most skill enchantments can only be placed on two items, reducing the massive power creep offered by armour enchantments. Magnitude values for fortifying many skills were extremely high in vanilla and have been significantly reduced (do you remember 50% magicka regeneration right from the beginning of the game?). New weakness enhancements can be put on weapons to allow spellswords to buff the damage of their spells and even poisons, which now can damage even draugr and automatons if their resistances are cut down. College robes with school-based enchantments have a unique enchantment that gives 25% cost reduction to level-appropriate spells from their specific school.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099">Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul&lt;/a> - After you pray at the shrine, you won&amp;rsquo;t get cured from any disease, but
you will get a power to pray everywhere, not only near shrines. Like always, when you do so, you get unique power from the deity you were praying to, but
a more unique one than those you get in vanilla. You can even take those powers further by obtaining two new perks in your Restoration or Conjuration tree.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746">Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul&lt;/a> - Gain extra armour rating, unarmed damage, health, stamina and magic resistance as you level to ensure that being a werewolf is relevant at higher levels of play.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639">Scion - A Vampire Overhaul&lt;/a> - Vampires were good enough in vanilla, but there was surely a room for improvement and fixing. Scion also scales your vampire lord form to be as relevant as the werewolf one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310">Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul&lt;/a> - Dragons are enemies you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take lightly. Now they are truly the main bosses of the game with all the changes to their stats and shouts, which even include some new tricks, which vanilla dragons weren&amp;rsquo;t capable of. The mod also introduces new different kinds of dragons and makes all types of dragons have resistances and weaknesses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276">Forceful Tongue - Shouts Overhaul&lt;/a> - Shouts scale, they don&amp;rsquo;t benefit from magic perks anymore, while actually being more useful in many situations other than just being our character&amp;rsquo;s gimmick.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Then there are some additional overhauls, which compliment these changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464">Timing is Everything&lt;/a> - Adjusts some quests to start at a later time to improve their balance as some quests have been made harder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427">Radiant Requirements&lt;/a> - Modifies radiant quests so that they don&amp;rsquo;t send you to locations with dangerous enemies until your level is high enough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47484">Adamant Perks for NPCs&lt;/a> - Adds some of the perks from our perk overhaul to a little amount of NPCs to make them stronger. No more unique strength from perks just for our player character. There is only 15% change of perks being added to NPC, so it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard for anyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28766">Crossbow Integration&lt;/a> - You will be able to see NPCs around Skyrim and Solstheim using different kinds of crossbows, while being able to use and craft them by yourself too. Enhanced Crossbows were renamed to &lt;em>Marksman&amp;rsquo;s Crossbows&lt;/em>, they do 4 points of damage less than their standard crossbow equivalent, but ignore 50% of armour and do critical damage equal to their damage. Dwarven crossbows and all explosive bolts can only be crafted once the relevant &lt;em>Ancient Technology&lt;/em> quests for the Dawnguard are completed or the reward for the quest &lt;em>Unfathomable Depths&lt;/em> quest has been acquired. Dawnguard crossbows also deal bonus damage to vampires now like other Dawnguard&amp;rsquo;s weapons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102">Smart NPC Potions&lt;/a> - Finally bandits, mages and assassins will also have an option to have
and use some potions. And not just healing potions, which they already use in vanilla to, to make our lives a little bit harder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32218">No Lockpicking&lt;/a> - The end of the annoying lockpicking game. Now your actual lockpicking skill is used to pick a lock, which make the skill much more useful. Locks will break according to your skill too. For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock,
you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That&amp;rsquo;s the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay.
But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to always lose at least 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more.
And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough),
you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026">Reading Is Good&lt;/a> - Makes us become smarter in an immersive way by giving us a permanent boost to a levelling speed in a skill, which we have read about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62613">Party Damage Control&lt;/a> - If you have 3 or more members inside your party, be ready that you all will deal much less damage than before. For example, if you have 3 members in your party (you + 2 people), you all will deal for 30% less physical damage, if there are 4 members - for 60% less physical damage and so on. A must have for balance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681">Open World Loot&lt;/a> - Rebalance of Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s loot system. It attempts to maintain the same open world feel of Skyrim while adjusting the levels certain items appear and makes it so Daedric and other special weapons must be acquired from special quests only. No longer will iron equipment be completely irrelevant in a matter of a few hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47115">Simple Smithing Overhaul&lt;/a> - Simply makes all recipes consistent with each other. I also used it to patch our armour and weapons mods&amp;rsquo; recipes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015">Honed Metal&lt;/a> - You are a person, who is destined to save the world, but to even do that you have to become the best blacksmith and/or enchanter in Skyrim too to craft a decent equipment to rely on. This can&amp;rsquo;t be immersive for each and every Dragonborn, so let&amp;rsquo;s make NPCs take care of that,
while introducing some disadvantages of getting gear with help of others such as their services being costly and taking time to complete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439">C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures&lt;/a> - Draugr will stop stealing any septims around Skyrim and bringing them to crypts. But if we serious, there are many different coins around Skyrim now in places, where septims didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, which will then be converted to their value in septims, when you pick them up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47225">Vampire Feeding Tweaks&lt;/a> - We were too polite with people. But not any more as now you will be able to bite and feast both in combat, by being sneaky if you are powerful enough and possibly by seeking blood of already deceased ones. Just press the activation button on your enemies, when these scenarios are met and when your weapon is unsheathed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-mechanics">New Mechanics&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68043">Jumping attacks&lt;/a> - Feel free to jump and swing, cast, shoot etc. all times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956">Dodging&lt;/a> - Spend some stamina to be able to dodge attack of your enemies while moving.
&lt;code>Mouse 4&lt;/code> button is chosen by default for dodging.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want to change the button for dodging, do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>SKELETON &amp;amp; ANIMATIONS EXTENDED&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click on &lt;em>TK Dodge RE&lt;/em> mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>INI files&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>SKSE\Plugins\TK Dodge RE.ini&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line 5, change &lt;em>DodgeHotkey&lt;/em> parameter according to instructions found &lt;a href="https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script#DXScanCodes">here&lt;/a> after &lt;em>=&lt;/em> sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Because of some kind of Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s oddities, for mouse buttons each of them there is actually for one unit smaller than in any other game or program. For example, &lt;code>Mouse 4&lt;/code> button is actually &lt;code>Mouse 3&lt;/code> button according to the Creation Kit&amp;rsquo;s documentation. Take that into consideration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>Save&lt;/em> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39157">Crouch sliding&lt;/a> - While sprinting, you can press &lt;code>Left Ctrl&lt;/code> button to perform crouch slide. Useful, when you need to hide as fast as possible or get to some kind of barrier between you and enemy while dodging projectiles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232">Interacting with different terrain&lt;/a> - Press &lt;code>;&lt;/code> button, then seek and interact with floating white orbs in dungeons to traverse through different obstacles on your way. Press the same button again to toggle orbs off (just for visuals, you will still be able to do all the action if you can guess where the markers are placed).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14098">Knocking&lt;/a> - Knock on locked doors by activating them. Good for roleplaying and also useful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882">Claiming strongholds&lt;/a> - Claim several outposts for the faction you support to keep hostile enemies from coming back making Skyrim a safer place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50250">Upgraded horses&lt;/a> - Realistic (faster) horse speed and better handling for horse riding. Increased base stamina of all horses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72165">Call your horse, put items in sachet&lt;/a> - Call your horse after fights by pressing &lt;code>H&lt;/code> button, hold &lt;code>H&lt;/code> button and then release it to open your horse&amp;rsquo;s inventory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63259">Control your followers&lt;/a> and/or &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66919">summons, resurrected enemies&lt;/a> behaviour - Use &lt;code>'&lt;/code> button to open a special menu for followers and/or summons to be able to make them wait or teleport them to you. Feel free to to do the same things and also dismiss and equip items to your summons and resurrected minions by simply activating them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/cae3x2/mod_improved_camera_beta_3/">Loot while riding on horse&lt;/a> - Loot as always by pressing &lt;code>E&lt;/code> button. Hold &lt;code>E&lt;/code> button to dismount.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256">Paragliding&lt;/a> - Be sure to travel around Falkreath. Something interesting might happen. When you get the paraglider, toggle paraglider by pressing your activation key
(&lt;code>E&lt;/code> by default), while in the air. After finding and learning neat spell around the platform, use your shout key (&lt;code>Z&lt;/code> by default) to fly higher. Paraglider can be used only in the third person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950">New powers for Dragonborn&lt;/a> - After finishing &lt;em>The Way of the Voice&lt;/em>, you will unlock an interesting power, which gives you access to a completely new custom perk tree. You will be able to upgrade this power by shouting and killing dragons. Accessible by pressing &lt;code>Tab&lt;/code> button and then by pressing &lt;code>?&lt;/code> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960">Respeccing&lt;/a> - Buy &lt;em>Draught of Fate Unwound&lt;/em> at Elgrimâ€™s Elixirs in Riften to automatically refund all your perks upon consuming it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="utility-tools-and-quality-of-life-additions">Utility Tools and Quality of Life Additions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/cae3x2/mod_improved_camera_beta_3/">Toggable camera&lt;/a> - Press &lt;code>F&lt;/code> key to toggle between the first and the third person view.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63247">Toggable compass&lt;/a> - Press &lt;code>X&lt;/code> key to turn it on and off when you need that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252">Camera&amp;rsquo;s side&lt;/a> - Change camera&amp;rsquo;s side by using your &lt;code>Mouse 5&lt;/code> key. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a mouse with many buttons, feel free to change bindings in &lt;em>Smoothcam&lt;/em>&amp;lsquo;s mod configuration menu in &lt;em>Thirdperson&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19189">Headtracking&lt;/a> - Press your &lt;code>V&lt;/code> key to disable or enable headtracking at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68540">Toggable headgear&lt;/a> - Use &lt;code>Arrow Down&lt;/code> button to toggle it off and on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56367">Even better map&lt;/a> - Try to use the map in a place like Blackreach and you will be pleasantly surprised. Also try zooming it all way out and then in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563">Add items from mods to your inventory&lt;/a> - A mod, which makes it possible to test all items other mods have to
offer inside their plugins. I have added it for people to know that there is an option like that and for your own testing purposes (can&amp;rsquo;t decide, which armour I would like to get more, let me see and then I will reload my earlier save). I hope you wonâ€™t use it for cheating.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41774">Do not kill anyone accidentally&lt;/a> - Mages in Skyrim suffer from their success as they can accidentally make friendly or neutral NPCs hostile towards themselves, while fighting with their enemies. Now you will do no damage to these NPCs by default. Press &lt;code>O&lt;/code> (letter) to toggle friendly fire. If you disable friendly fire, allies will still tolerate you if you hit them, but mainly during combat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21085">Looting quickly&lt;/a> - One of the best additions to Fallout 4 (FO4) was the looting menu,
which appears right when you move your cursor over lootable item without need to open game&amp;rsquo;s full menu. This mod allows us to use this addition,
but in Skyrim.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54217">No fast travelling&lt;/a> - By default fast travel is disabled, because it becomes much more interesting that way (you travel and discover much more) and there are plenty of ways to travel around - as in vanilla (horses, carriages, boats), paragliding, spells and another mean, which is tied to a quest (don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil that). If you still aren&amp;rsquo;t sold, feel free to reenable it by disabling &lt;em>Disable Fast Travel SKSE - No Janky Map UI&lt;/em> mod under the &lt;em>INTERFACE EXTENDED&lt;/em> separator before starting your adventure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27184">Binding items&lt;/a> - Now you can bind not just one item to one button, but much more. Feel free to check the mod to learn how to set it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50125">Hiding quests&lt;/a> - Gives you an option to hide a quest you will do later from your journal by
using MCM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47329">No need to remember combinations on the claws any more&lt;/a> - Just interact with the keyhole to have it automatically solve itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51125">Forgetting your older spells&lt;/a> - Forget spells you don&amp;rsquo;t use any more by going into the spells menu and pressing &lt;code>R&lt;/code> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40801">Automatically changing outfits according to different scenarios&lt;/a> - For example, I use it to change my default gear to ordinary clothing with speech etc. enchantments for traders, when I am inside big cities. Be sure to check its MCM to activate it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64339">Stealing without accidents&lt;/a> - Now you need to be crouched to &lt;em>see&lt;/em> items, which aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones in containers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35464">Clairvoyance (&lt;em>Guiding Wisp&lt;/em> now)&lt;/a> - Clairvoyance, but much more useful. Just try it out (be sure that you have an active quest in your journal).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50559">Animated shouts&lt;/a> - Press your &lt;code>Right Alt&lt;/code> key to disable or enable animated shouts at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41856">Appreciation to followers&lt;/a> - Allows you to thank your companions for being with you during hard times. Just tell them that you are glad they are helping you. The appreciation works in the other way too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45500">Horses for followers&lt;/a> - All vanilla stables have a second horse for sale that you can buy from them when you have a vanilla follower. All buyable player horse are flagged as protected and behave cowardly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52397">Werewolves&lt;/a> - Now there are much more of them than in vanilla Skyrim and they look pretty different from each other. And be accurate as now there is another way of becoming a werewolf, which you will maybe discover after fighting with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44557">Enemies during College of Winterhold quest line&lt;/a> - Now you will actually need magic to beat College of Winterhold. You have been warned. Conjured minions, enhanced weapons, illusion, of course, destruction magic, shouts. Good, old steel isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29508">Hjerim without joining the war&lt;/a> - It is enough to just take the care of the Butcher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35736">Revert back to your human form after feasting as werewolf (or vampire)&lt;/a> - Just press &lt;code>Q&lt;/code> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42212">Sun can&amp;rsquo;t just kill you as a vampire&lt;/a> - Now you can be safe from sun the same way as Serana by wearing any kind of head gear on you (circlets don&amp;rsquo;t count).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="anniversary-upgrade">Anniversary Upgrade&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Rare Curios&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Cause&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Forgotten Seasons&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I feel that I included some of the best creations available, which blend in well with the content we get from other mods. Unfortunately, there are also ones, which conflict with the already existing content (like Divine Crusader with Tate Taylor&amp;rsquo;s Knight of the North and Interesting NPCs) and can&amp;rsquo;t be added, also some, which are already available to us and even better quality (like Artifacts - The Ice Blade of the Monarch or Artifacts - The Breton Paladin), but if you believe that there are another hidden gems behind the remaining CC, feel free to share in the corresponding channels of feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All creations, which are related to armours and weapons, you can get the same way as every other gear - by looting or by making your own equipment. But it works the same way as with other items, so don&amp;rsquo;t expect to find new piece of Dwarven equipment, while being low level. Also quests associated with these armours and weapons were removed as they lacked interesting content to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be able to find the information about how to start the Creation Content&amp;rsquo;s quests later in the guide, while Rare Curious is available right from the beginning by finding Khajiit caravans.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beginner-tips">Beginner Tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now some juicy tips for peeps, who are still here after mingling with the fork:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be sure to do the main quest series as some added quests are tied to it (more information later).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For people, who would want to adopt children and live with them (and/or with your spouse) not in vanilla homes,
there will be a neat spell book waiting for you somewhere around Riverwood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aela in a way is much more unique than other followers in battle. Pick her on a tough adventure to learn how. Lydia and Serana also have been changed and even more. Be ready for a big improvement. Also be ready that you will be able to get a follower you haven&amp;rsquo;t even thought you will be able to play together with in vanilla.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of the added armour can be crafted by yourself only after reading specific materials. I would have started looking in one of the cities, which makes the most sense to be associated with clothing. Other books will be pretty close.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel free to use Divine Elegance Store near Old Hroldan inn. I have added it to serve a resource for making different screenshots. Of course,
you can also use all those outfits, accessories etc. to make your character just prettier. There are things for everyone to play with, even warriors.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="player-homes">Player Homes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The modpack features a bunch of different player homes. Some of them by default don&amp;rsquo;t have any immersive way to get them, they are available to you right from the start of the game,
so I have locked them and hidden the keys all round Skyrim. To find them, you will have to solve these riddles:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Viking&amp;rsquo;s Longhouse&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Makes it possible to make a respite for each weary traveller.
Home of hundreds.
Will burn greatly!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Red Rose Mill&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goat!
Inside realm of pleasure and revelry.
Some nights should better be forgotten, but will be remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ruska&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sight of nature, life. Time to bask in its glory.
Then some peace in the soothing hot springs.
Those three, not ever talking hunters&amp;hellip; Great! Will stay here for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wind Path&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first, the second, the third and the fourth teacher of the Dovah came outside. Still didn&amp;rsquo;t see the fifth one.
Those trainings&amp;hellip; Running like the wind&amp;hellip;
The one, who talks, finally took Dovah to meditate with him to the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Scrivener&amp;rsquo;s Croft&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes the things we need are right near us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-quests">New Quests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And then just a little heads up and how and when and how you should start newly added quests. They can be split between early and mid game and late game ones,
because their difficulty slightly differs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="early-and-mid-game-quests">Early and Mid Game Quests&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Wheel of Time&lt;/strong> - literally just cross the Riverwood&amp;rsquo;s bridge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Falskaar&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time. Go to Riften and speak with Jalamar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time by going northeast
from Winterhold. A journal can be found there in small ruins, which will
point you to the location with a ship marker. Should be done without a
follower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clockwork&lt;/strong> - Automatically after reaching level 5. Without a follower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Beyond Skyrim - Bruma&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time in &lt;em>Pale Pass&lt;/em> (will be
marked as two rocks together) southeast of Helgen. Personally recommend to start it at level 10.
Some zones further from where you start the mod&amp;rsquo;s quest will be much harder in the beginning like in Skyrim.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moonpath to Elsweyr&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time in Brumaâ€™s &lt;em>Greenwood&lt;/em>,
the southernmost point of County Bruma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moon and Star&lt;/strong> - Automatically after finishing the main quest &lt;em>The Way of the Voice.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Carved Bink&lt;/strong> - After reaching level 10 in &lt;em>Abandoned Grotto&lt;/em> west of Lost
Knife Hideout.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Project AHO&lt;/strong> - After reaching level 15, head to Braidwood Inn (located at Kynesgrove) and talk to the innkeeper. Without a follower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Midwood Isle&lt;/strong> - Automatically after finishing the main quest &lt;em>The Way of the Voice.&lt;/em> Recommend to start it at level 15-20.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wyrmstooth&lt;/strong> - automatically after Level 10 and after finishing the main
quest &lt;em>A Blade in the Dark&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Forgotten Seasons&lt;/strong> - Find and enter into Runoff Caverns, which are very close to Lost Valley Redoubt (and/or read a note in one of the mercenaries&amp;rsquo; tents that serves as an alternate way to begin the quest). I recommend to be close to level 20.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Wheels of Lull&lt;/strong> - Automatically after reaching level 20, can be finished after reaching level 35.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Helgen Reborn&lt;/strong> - &lt;strong>Must&lt;/strong> be started after 5 days after you have finished the main quest &lt;em>Unbound&lt;/em> to make sure that Helgen has bandits inside it.
Otherwise it can work incorrectly. Recommended to be started at level 20. &lt;em>Note&lt;/em> in the Bannered Mare can be activated to start the quest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Tools of Kagrenac&lt;/strong> - Join College of Winterhold and finish the
side questline &lt;em>Arnielâ€™s Endeavor&lt;/em>. Youâ€™ll also need to have finished
&lt;em>The Way of the Voice&lt;/em>. A couple of days after you completed &lt;em>Arnielâ€™s
Endeavor&lt;/em> and claimed &lt;em>Keening&lt;/em>, the quest will start automatically. Make
sure you have Keening in your inventory, it will turn into a quest item
when the mod starts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/strong> - After reaching level 20 and after
pickpocketing or stealing anything. Level 30-35 is recommended, for
thief characters (sneaking and pickpocketing).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="late-game-quests">Late Game Quests&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Forgotten City&lt;/strong> - Automatically after reaching level 30. The story
responds to your characterâ€™s individual history, actions, so a high
level of speech skill (approximately 60) is also recommended. Enemies
will be pretty tough, but not as tough as within other late game quests.
Thatâ€™s and also the immersiveness is the reason for setting this quest
requirements as high, because by default it starts at level 5. Without a
follower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Undeath&lt;/strong> - Automatically without anything happening after reaching level
30 (I know, not immersive, unfortunately the patch for making it start
in a better way was removed from Nexus, going to deal with that later,
the late game quest, considered you should have gotten it after one
Dragonborn quest).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Cause&lt;/strong> - Creation&amp;rsquo;s questline really suffered from the lack of voice acting and that&amp;rsquo;s why the mod&amp;rsquo;s dungeons were turned into normal locations that you can stumble across and explore at your leisure. Find an entrance east from Falkreath or enter in the are from Bruma&amp;rsquo;s side. Enemies are still going to be hard (before the quest of The Cause started automatically after reaching level 46). Also better explore well as there will be a key around for a very interesting location in Skyrim associated with Daedra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Ice Blade of the Monarch&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time in &lt;em>Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s
Trench&lt;/em> northeast of The Tower Stone, hard mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Tournament of the Ten Bloods&lt;/strong> - Can be started after reading &lt;em>The
Story of Lyrisius&lt;/em> in the Arcanaeum, hard mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Breton Paladin&lt;/strong> - Can be started any time by praying, hard mod after the first part of the quest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Grand Paladin&lt;/strong> - After reading a book &lt;em>The Grand Paladin&lt;/em> in Bards
College or Skaal&amp;rsquo;s Village Great Hall and after
finishing the main quest &lt;em>Dragon Rising&lt;/em>. Having more than 300 health is
highly recommended. PC must be able to shout, very hard mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Wonâ€™t tell you any other details about your potential new
followers and other surprises like improved vanilla quests as they should be discovered pretty easily
while exploring. I hope you were intrigued about something from the modpack and this guide helped to learn about that a bit more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skyrim-Se: Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/faq/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Does my installation folder need to be the same one that I used for TPF if I want to have both TPF and the fork?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is possible to have both TPF and my fork&amp;rsquo;s WJ versions on your computer by making different installation folders for them. Your downloads folder can and should be the same to make the installation process faster and not to make you download TPF&amp;rsquo;s mods once again.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some mods appear as not downloaded in Mod Organizer 2. Is that intended?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well, it isn&amp;rsquo;t, but it is just purely visual bug of MO2, which happens when you use Wabbajack to install the list. Nevermind it.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Are all releases of the list available to be downloaded?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes, you will be able to find them on &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973">TPF DE&amp;rsquo;s Nexus page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content">Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Will any of the survival mods or Legacy of the Dragonborn ever be added to TPF DE?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>No. There are already many modpacks and guides, which are built around LotD and/or survival mechanic in mind, and that is enough. In my opinion, LotD is too intrusive and makes you work around it for too much, while not actually offering as much, and I just don&amp;rsquo;t like survival mode overall as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make gameplay more enjoyable. It does exactly the opposite - makes the game more annoying to play. Each game should have its boundaries of immersiveness. For me it is a fantasy, where I want to enjoy what I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly experience at all or as much in my daily life, so I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly need to think about how character eats, drinks, washes themselves and does other everyday things.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What about that, that and&amp;hellip; that?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Feel free to check my &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u030JaTyAtv5IT2uMx-0oHidyLpXGPuf?usp=sharing">feedback reports&lt;/a> if you want to know which mods possibly won&amp;rsquo;t make it into the list. I usually make it pretty clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is overall difficulty and combat changed by the list?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Combat is affected primarily by Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul, which adds complexity to the vanilla hack-and-slash system. It adds emphasis on stamina management and movement. Also it adjusts the difficulty modifiers, slightly increasing incoming damage. With those changes, combat will feel noticeably more difficult than vanilla to the point where you may be one-shot by certain enemy types.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall it is harder considering the fact that vanilla was too easy, but it definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t something you can&amp;rsquo;t handle, because we aren&amp;rsquo;t playing Dark Souls, but at the same time you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like to press random buttons to win. By the way I have added some mechanics to places, where TPF has made no changes and which aren&amp;rsquo;t intrusive. For example, adding a 15% chance of giving useful perks for NPCs to make them more interesting to fight, getting rid of the lock-picking mini game and actually using our lock-picking skill to succeed in picking locks etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Refer to &lt;a href="../gameplay-guide">the gameplay guide&lt;/a> if you want to learn more about the list.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can I improve modpack&amp;rsquo;s performance on my computer?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Downscale your resolution if you are playing on 1440p or bigger monitor by applying the settings from the installation guide. Check those &lt;a href="../installation-guide#configurations">here&lt;/a>. Try your changes in the game. Stop if it is enough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change our PI-CHO ENB to its more performance friendly version or to completely different ENB, which are meant to be more performance friendly. Those ENBs aren&amp;rsquo;t as beautiful, but they are great for gameplay and don&amp;rsquo;t go so hard on your computer. You can find the instructions about how to remove the current ENB &lt;a href="../installation-guide#in-game-adjustments">here&lt;/a> in quick tips. The most performance friendly ones I know are Truth ENB, Serio&amp;rsquo;s ENB and Cathedral Minimalist ENB. It is up to you to find them, choose the best one for you and then follow the chosen one&amp;rsquo;s instructions to apply it to your game. If you need some assistance to change it, feel free to ask in &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm">TPF Discord server&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;em>#enb-talk&lt;/em> channel. Try your changes in the game. Stop if it is enough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Setup resolution scale according to the same instructions in the installation guide &lt;a href="../installation-guide#configurations">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can I play with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yep, it should be as easy as connecting a controller. The only potential issue would be lack of bindable hotkeys for mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can I change in-game real time clock format to 12 hour one?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>INTERFACE&lt;/em> separator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click on &lt;em>KenMOD - Time On Loading Screen&lt;/em> mod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &lt;em>Text files&lt;/em> tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line 4, change &lt;em>&amp;amp;twelveHourClock&lt;/em> parameter to &lt;code>1&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press on &lt;em>Save&lt;/em> button or use &lt;code>Ctrl&lt;/code> + &lt;code>S&lt;/code> shortcut.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Skyrim-Se: Bug Reporting</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/bug-reporting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/bug-reporting/</guid><description>
&lt;p>To better understand and fix problems related to the modpack I would need to get a decent report, not something like &lt;em>nothing is working wtf help plz&lt;/em>.
In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your best to follow these simple rules and principles of bug reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning&lt;/strong>: Don&amp;rsquo;t expect support for adding any other mods or for your modified setups of the modlist.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>At first, everyone in the community are just people,
who have their own life and work to do. I and other users can offer resources and tips about dealing with mod conflicts in the respective channels,
but we aren&amp;rsquo;t robots to know each and every mod and its consequences on the modpack. You can believe that mods are simply compatible out of the box if
you didn&amp;rsquo;t have any CTDs right at the start of the game, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that. That is why you are here. I understand that can be scary for beginners,
but it really is how it is. You will need some effort from your side in order to make the game more suited for yourself. So if you can add something, do it. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, learn how to do it. Here are some good resources for the beginning - &lt;a href="https://moddingskyrim.com/">ModdingSkyrim website&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/Main.md">Lively&amp;rsquo;s Learn How To Wiki&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources">Alhtro&amp;rsquo;s Modding Resources&lt;/a>. If you tried, but something is still not right,
you can ask for advice in &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm">TPF Discord server&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;em>#tpf-de-modifications&lt;/em> or &lt;em>#mod-talk&lt;/em> channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At second, support with in-game issues is offered in &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm">TPF Discord server&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;em>#tpf-de-wabbajack-support&lt;/em> and &lt;em>#tpf-de-crash-reports&lt;/em> channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To get to these channels in the server, simply find &lt;em>#role-settings&lt;/em> channel and choose my role, new channels then will appear in the server&amp;rsquo;s list.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>At third, if another person reports any kind of issue you have too, mention that you are having the same issue.
That is important for me, because then I will know that issue is global and maybe I will need your help to resolve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="report-requirements">Report Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Confirmation that you haven&amp;rsquo;t modified the modpack;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ENB, MCM, configuration mentioned in the installation guide and/or display related settings&amp;rsquo; adjustments are understandable if you know what you are doing. ANY other additions or changes - not.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Version of the fork;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can be found on the first separator inside the mod organizer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Screenshot or video of the problem if appliable, crashlog if appliable;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When the problem is seeable, open the console (&lt;code>~&lt;/code> key) and press on the problem to see maybe the console gives more information on the source of the issue. Then copy and paste in the report or just use any kind of video sharing service.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Crashlogs can be found inside &lt;em>/NetScriptFramework/Crash&lt;/em> folder in Overwrite. You can find Overwrite by scrolling all the way down in Mod Organizers&amp;rsquo; left pane.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Description of the problem (what, when, where);&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>How to repeat the issue if appliable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the issue canâ€™t be repeated at least 3 times, I wonâ€™t be able to help.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="examples-for-your-bug-report">Examples for Your Bug Report&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from console in &lt;em>#tpf-de-wabbajack-support&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I am on the unmodified version 1.0 of TPF DE. Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the city one of the guards has a black face.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A person has sent me a crashlog in &lt;em>#tpf-de-crash-reports&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I am on the unmodified version 1.0 of TPF DE. If I try to enter into Whiterun, the game crashes. Tried to enter 2 more times, but the issue is still there. Crashlogs were all the same.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skyrim-Se: Changelog</title><link>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de/changelog/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="release-292">Release 2.9.2&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>09.09.2022&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is save compatible, but before updating you need to reset your perk points. Check the gameplay guide to learn how to do that.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time just an update to fix some sort of Nexus issues related to Adamant by just updating it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updated-mods">Updated Mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adamant - A Perk Overhaul&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="release-291">Release 2.9.1&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>07.09.2022&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is save compatible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just an update for some mods, fixes and tweaks for better gameplay. The biggest addition this time would be an introduction of a toggable friendly fire blocker, which mages are probably going to enjoy the most. Be sure to check the full changelog if you would like to learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="added-mods">Added Mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Simple Offence Suppression MCM - Block Friendly Fire&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simple Offence Suppression Block Friendly Fire - Add-on&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Now you will do no damage to neutral NPCs by default. Press &lt;code>O&lt;/code> to toggle friendly fire. If you disable friendly fire, allies will still tolerate you if you hit them, but only during combat. Feel free to report if you feel that I need to introduce some changes to this system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pristine Vanilla Movement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some people didn&amp;rsquo;t like our running and sprinting animations, so I have decided to come back to neutral classics, but not without the upgrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pretty Combat Animations - Magic Left Hand + Staff Right Hand Sprinting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="removed-mods">Removed Mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Elegant Candlelight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strange Runes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Considering the fact that it can play not so well with a bunch of mods including even gameplay ones like Adamant and Mysticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Undeath - XPMSSE - Strange Runes - Skeleton Patch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goetia Animations - Sprint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goetia Animations - Male Walk And Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goetia Animations - Female Walk And Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="changes">Changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Turned off Gilded restoration time on new saves.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Apparently that led to CTDs some people were experiencing. Thanks to JustIChris. To use this option on existing saves, open CLockwork&amp;rsquo;s MCM and change Gilded resurrection time to 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Turned on player&amp;rsquo;s killmove immunity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It should have been turned on right from the beginning, but I guess I have forgotten about that. It also will resolve issues with CTDs some users were having, when NPCs gutted them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed Serana&amp;rsquo;s hair being blue with hood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed some rocks looking oddly in Shatterstone Scar.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Thanks to Prizz.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nerfed Aligning the Matrix Weave spell.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added a note about how to build correctly Lakeview Manor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Made Pickaxe of the Impatient behave like other axes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="updated-mods-1">Updated Mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Serana Dialogue Add-On&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Undeath - Classical Lichdom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Undeath Classical Lichdom - The Ascension&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xelzaz - Custom Fully Voiced Argonian Telvanni Follower&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remiel - Custom Voiced Dwemer Specialist and Companion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="release-29">Release 2.9&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>07.08.2022&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New save is required.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About sad things, at first. Even thou I have asked people to fill in the feedback survey, at the moment I was writing this only 39 people have filled it up. After the first feedback survey was closed, 50 people were able to help thou the list at that time has being in use by less people. I have decided not to do the feedback report. I guess many just people don&amp;rsquo;t care, so I won&amp;rsquo;t care about reporting too much either. :P Thanks to those people, who really tried, you will be able to partially get the report by reading the changelog. We are going to see how it goes later, but soon the survey will be closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About happy things. I would say this update is more about polishing our landscapes, while also improving some other aspects of the game. Now you will able to enjoy Happy Little Trees in their full glory together with mods, which compliment them like Happy Little Shrubs and our improved LOD. Also welcome another band of cats to our Skyrim from Khajiit Will Follow, new content addition. Some of items from mods became much more unique thanks to Snazzy Items series of mods, while bards are more happy, because not only Dragonborn troubles them not as often as always, but also because now they reside in their beautiful JK&amp;rsquo;s Bards College. Also now you can toggle animated traversal action markers by pressing &lt;code>;&lt;/code> button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also our main page and the guides are now on Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s website, feel free to check it out - &lt;a href="https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de">https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de&lt;/a>. I have tried to make each documentation piece even better than before, so let&amp;rsquo;s hope it will help even more people than before.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Iron Dusk&amp;rsquo;s Laboratory - Saddlebags&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seasonal Aspen Trees&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would like to try full Happy Little Trees suite especially with all the new mods complimenting them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Toggle Compass Hotkey&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Darkend&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Final Cataclysm - 2020&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Unfortunately these two mods have a bunch of problems, which have been giving me headache for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Project AHO ENB Patch&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Actually not needed with Project AHO Sadrith Kegran ENB Fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Custom Skills Menu&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Unfortunately it working together with JContainers is a reason for some people experiencing CTDs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sweeping Organizes Stuff - Use Broom to Clean Mess&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>After using it, in many situations items start jiggling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Refined Volkihars&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I guess bringing Charmers of the Reach meshes wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good plan from my part. I just love how close to vanilla, but still beautiful Serana looks with it, thou maybe our Serana needs to have a bit more mature look, which is offered by Pandorable&amp;rsquo;s Serana.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="changes-1">Changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed Solitude&amp;rsquo;s Castle Dour look from exteriors and a bit of Markarth looking funky during winter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Toned down maximum brightness in interiors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tweaked saturation down just a bit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Increased shadow draw distance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changed all our walking, running and sprinting animations to Goetia&amp;rsquo;s ones. The other animations related to movement were removed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Made animated traversal action markers toggable by pressing &lt;code>;&lt;/code> button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disabled actor fade so fights with dragons won&amp;rsquo;t look odd if camera is pretty close to them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scrubs (which you can see inside Whiterun, some are even on roads) are looking normal now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added Lawbringer patch to the new Silent Moons Camp.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many other fixes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="updated-mods-2">Updated Mods&lt;/h3>
