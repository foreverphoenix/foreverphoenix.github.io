&lt;h2 id="what-are-mods">What are mods?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mods are fan-made modifications that change or add to the original game. It can do anything from changing the texture of apples to adding a massive new worldspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus&lt;/a>, the primary hub for mods, there are around &lt;strong>85.000&lt;/strong> mods available for Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition (including duplicates). Some of them are absolutely essential, for some better alternatives exist, some are very specific patches, some are redundant, outdated or outright broken. Some require the Script Extender or other mods. Some need additional steps to be completed before they work properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Navigating the sheer amount of mods out there requires time, patience and some understanding of how mods work (or a guide that takes you through the process).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modding">&amp;ldquo;Modding&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The term &amp;ldquo;modding&amp;rdquo; is fairly ambiguous: It can mean &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>creating mods&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; as well as &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>installing mods&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Creating mods&lt;/strong> is fairly complex. The Creation Kit (Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s official modding tool) is notoriously clunky and prone to crashes (until at least the Skyrim SE version got fixed by a modder). Writing scripts in the engine’s scripting language Papyrus requires a good deal of prior coding experience. Script extender plugins are written in C++. Tinkering with textures requires at least basic skills in Photoshop, Gimp or a similar program. Modelling (editing or creating new meshes) requires very specific software like Blender which is extremely complex and cannot be learned overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installing mods&lt;/strong> is quite a bit easier and certainly more accessible. In fact, when it comes down to it, the only hard requirement is the ability to read closely. &amp;ldquo;Casual&amp;rdquo; modding - installing perhaps five or ten interesting mods - does not really require any extra steps, it is enough to drop all files into a certain folder. Depending on what these five or ten mods do, this may work out perfectly, but for anything more than that, you will have to go the extra mile, and you will have to invest time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In order to learn how to create mods, one needs to know how mods work, what components they are made of and how they can be edited. On the other hand, installing mods is not usually a matter of &amp;ldquo;plug and play&amp;rdquo; as some instructions would have you believe, at least not if you are using more than three or four mods. Eventually the line between the two will blur, and the better you get at installing mods and making them work together, the closer you get to actually making mods yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="permissions">Permissions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unlike other modding communities (such as Minecraft&amp;rsquo;s), sharing permissions are very strict for the vast majority of Skyrim mods. Mods for Bethesda games have a long history of being re-used without credits to the original author which explains the general unwillingness of most mod authors to grant free permissions, especially not for unedited re-uploads. As such, mod packs do not exist. The term &amp;ldquo;mod pack&amp;rdquo; is extremely controversial in the community. It is not advisable to use it in any context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Wabbajack tool, it is now possible to share modded setups without re-uploading the mods themselves, effectively replacing mod packs. Put simply, Wabbajack can scan a mod list, compile a list of links for all files and take note of edits made to mods. The generated output can be shared and used to replicate the setup, automatically downloading the same files and applying the edits made in the source setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="skyrim-le-vs-skyrim-se">Skyrim LE vs Skyrim SE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The original game released in 2011 – &lt;strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&lt;/strong> – was re-released later as the &lt;strong>Legendary Edition&lt;/strong> packaged with all three DLCs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn). This version of the game is known as &lt;strong>Skyrim LE&lt;/strong>, Classic Skyrim or Oldrim, built on an older 32-bit version of the Creation Engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2016, Skyrim was re-released in remastered form as &lt;strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition&lt;/strong>, now based on an updated and improved 64-bit version of the Creation Engine with marginally better visuals and substantially improved stability. It is referred to as &lt;strong>Skyrim SE&lt;/strong> and was released alongside the dreaded Creation Club but revitalised the modding scene in spite of initial doubts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several years after the release of the Special Edition, the modding community has long caught up. With many new mods available exclusively for this version of the game as well as stability being much so easier to achieve, Skyrim Special Edition is the better choice for modded setups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most Wabbajack mod lists are made for Skyrim SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hosting-platforms">Hosting Platforms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As mentioned, the vast majority of mods are hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods&lt;/a>, a massive hub for mods supporting over 250 games. Unsurprisingly, Bethesda games are ranking at the top with tens of thousands of mods each. The Nexus features detailed mod pages giving authors a comprehensive tool set to publish, document and support their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another host for Skyrim Special Edition mods is Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/">Beth.net&lt;/a> platform which includes a very rudimentary mod hub with a fraction of the features that the Nexus offers. Many popular mods are available on both platforms, although Bethnet “exclusives” are usually inferior to Nexus alternatives because they were made for consoles. Bethnet mods can be downloaded through the in-game mod manager which is capable of loading plugins and nothing else. While this may be interesting for XBOX or Playstation owners, Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s modding platform and integration is so vastly inferior to the Nexus that it is simply irrelevant for actual PC modding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly irrelevant is the &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/">Steam Workshop&lt;/a> for Skyrim SE, also hosting a number of mods that are available on the Nexus already - either directly or through a (usually superior) alternative. Like on Beth.net, mods installed through the Steam Workshop are simply dumped into your game folder with no way to properly manage them beyond installing / uninstalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-script-extender">The Script Extender&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important tool / resource / mod available for Skyrim is the &lt;strong>Skyrim Script Extender&lt;/strong>, or &lt;strong>SKSE&lt;/strong> for short. The Script Extender for Skyrim Special Edition is usually referred to as &lt;strong>SKSE64&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Creation Kit allows modders to work with a tool set similar to what the developers used, the Script Extender goes a step further and hooks directly into the engine. In order for it to function properly, the game must be run through the Script Extender executable instead of the original launcher. As the name suggests, it &amp;ldquo;extends scripts&amp;rdquo;, or more specifically the available functions modders can call in their scripts. It is not exactly a mod but rather a modder’s resource.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the added functionality of the Script Extender, mods like the interface overhaul &lt;strong>SkyUI&lt;/strong> and its &lt;strong>Mod Configuration Menu&lt;/strong> component are made possible in the first place. Many features that would otherwise be difficult to implement can be realised through Script Extender plugins such as the mod &lt;strong>SSE Engine Fixes&lt;/strong> which rewrites sections of the Creation Engine itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Script Extender and any SKSE plugin is &lt;strong>version dependent&lt;/strong> and only works with the game version it was made for. For example, SKSE64 2.0.17 is only compatible with Skyrim SE 1.5.97, and will not work with any other version of the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-note-on-consoles">A Note on Consoles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For Skyrim Special Edition and Fallout 4, modding is &amp;ldquo;supported&amp;rdquo; on consoles (XBOX One and Playstation 4) through Bethesda’s own platform. However, the available options as far as mod installation and configuration go are so severely limited on consoles that it isn’t even comparable to what is possible on PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No assets on PS4.&lt;/strong> Thanks to Sony, only plugins (a central component of many mods) can be installed on Playstations. Without the ability to include scripts, textures, meshes or other loose files, mod authors are severely limited in their options.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No script extender.&lt;/strong> Most complex mods will never work for consoles because they require SKSE. Others need workarounds and extremely jarring ingame items for their configuration. You cannot install any mods that fix engine bugs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No tweaking of mods.&lt;/strong> There is no way to remove or edit files from a mod (unless you are the author and repackage it on PC), or edit the INI files of either the game or mods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Limited space.&lt;/strong> If memory serves, there is about 5GB of space for mods on the XBOX. Compare this to a decent modded setup on PC which easily cracks 100GB.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Limited hardware.&lt;/strong> Graphic improvements are possible but only on a very small scale due to hardware restrictions. Post processing injectors like ENBSeries or even ReShade cannot be installed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you truly intend to get into modding, you need a PC. There is simply no way around it. And yes, you can play modded Skyrim with a controller on PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-creation-club">The Creation Club&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For all the engine improvements we enjoy on the Special Edition, there is a catch and it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://creationclub.bethesda.net/en">Creation Club&lt;/a>&amp;quot;. Additional content for Skyrim SE made by Bethesda devs or independent contractors (many of them well-known modders) is sold for &amp;ldquo;credits&amp;rdquo; which must be bought with real-world currency. While Beth goes through great pains to argue that these &amp;ldquo;creations&amp;rdquo; are not in fact paid mods, they certainly are micro-transactions, and in a single-player game no less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most immediate problem with the Creation Club is that nobody can ignore it. Even those who are totally uninterested in buying micro DLC for Skyrim will be affected every time the shop is updated with more content as these updates somehow require Bethesda to update the game executable (SkyrimSE.exe) every time. This in turn requires the Script Extender and all SKSE plugins to be updated, a huge inconvenience for everyone involved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beginners-Guide: Technical Basics</title><link>http://thephoenixflavour.com/beginners-guide/modding-basics/technical-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thephoenixflavour.com/beginners-guide/modding-basics/technical-basics/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="vanilla-skyrim">Vanilla Skyrim&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="the-root-folder">The Root Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After installing Skyrim SE through Steam, the installation folder will have a size of about 13GB. This folder is referred to as the &lt;strong>Root&lt;/strong> folder and contains (among other files) the game’s executables: SkyrimSE.exe and SkyrimSELauncher.exe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any mods that must be installed into the &lt;strong>Root&lt;/strong> folder cannot be installed with a mod manager and must be moved into the root folder manually. Examples of mods that belong in the &lt;strong>Root&lt;/strong> folder are SKSE, ENBSeries, and CK Fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-data-folder">The Data Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root folder also contains another important directory: the &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong> folder. This is where the vast majority of mods belong, and mod managers are typically used to manage its contents. Confusing the &lt;strong>Root&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong> folders will lead to mods not working, as they need to be in the correct directory in order for the game to recognise them, so be sure to keep the difference in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inside the &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong> folder you can find the &amp;ldquo;skeleton&amp;rdquo; of vanilla Skyrim: its five master plugins and associated archives. All game files are stored here in these two file formats. These are the five master plugins (or official master files):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Skyrim.esm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Update.esm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dawnguard.esm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HearthFires.esm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dragonborn.esm&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The first is the original game’s plugin and the largest of them all. The second one contains all additions and fixes that were patched in post-launch and for the Special Edition re-release. The remaining three plugins belong to the DLC as the names indicate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ini-folder">The INI Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After running the game for the first time, the INI folder, containing the game’s configuration files, will be generated. Besides the &lt;strong>Skyrim.ini&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>SkyrimPrefs.ini&lt;/strong> (which store the game’s settings), the INI folder also contains the &lt;strong>Saves&lt;/strong> folder with your save files.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There will be several more folders added automatically later on where certain mods store their LOG files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="folder-types">Folder Types&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As the above should have made clear, it&amp;rsquo;s important to move files into the proper directories, otherwise they simply won&amp;rsquo;t work. Installing the Skyrim Script Extender or ENBSeries into the Data folder is a very common beginner&amp;rsquo;s mistake. Over the course of the Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide and throughout the Full Guide, I will refer to those three folders simply by the names defined here (Root, Data, and INI folder).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plugins">Plugins&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="elder-scrolls-plugins">Elder Scrolls Plugins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Plugins are files with the extensions ESP, ESL, or ESM. They edit records from Skyrim’s master files or add new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common plugin format is the &lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Plugin&lt;/strong> (ESP), and it is used for the majority of mods. ESPs can be created using the official modding tool, the Creation Kit, or the community’s tool, SSEEdit, and they can contain all kinds of data for cells, worldspaces, NPCs, their behaviours and appearances, game rules, quests with their different stages, dialogue, and so on. Vanilla Skyrim does not have any ESPs, only ESMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Master&lt;/strong> plugins (ESM) are always loaded at the top of your load order, before your ESPs. An ESP always requires at least one ESM which is usually Skyrim.esm. However, ESPs may also require other ESPs. These dependencies are not mere suggestions; they are hard requirements, and missing a plugin’s required master will result in errors and crashes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible to flag an ESP as ESM. This will cause the plugin to load near the top of your load order and above the regular ESPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-limit-and-esl-plugins">Plugin Limit and ESL Plugins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can load a maximum of 255 ESPs and ESMs (including the five master files) into the game. If you exceed that limit, Skyrim will crash on launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elder Scrolls Light&lt;/strong> plugins (ESL) are, however, the exception. They are smaller: they have a lower formID budget, meaning that they can store less data, which is why they are often used for smaller mods, patches, or dummy plugins. ESLs are loaded in their own plugin space, and they will always be moved below your ESMs and above your ESPs in your load order. You can load about 4096 ESL plugins, but the exact number varies as it depends on the amount of data each ESL stores. ESL plugins were originally added in 2017 for the Creation Club.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final plugin type is a hybrid of either ESM or ESP with an added ESL flag. By flagging an ESM or ESP as ESL, you may force it to load in ESL space and prevent it from counting toward the 255 ESM+ESP limit. Additionally, you will be able to manipulate its load order instead of being forced to load it between ESMs and ESPs. An &amp;ldquo;ESL-ified&amp;rdquo; master plugin – &lt;strong>ESM-ESL&lt;/strong> - will load at the top of your load order with the other ESMs, while an &amp;ldquo;ESL-ified&amp;rdquo; regular plugin - &lt;strong>ESP-Lite&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>ESP-FE&lt;/strong> - will load with all other ESPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can flag any plugin as ESL so long as it does not exceed the maximum amount of FormIDs. If the plugin adds new FormIDs (that are not part of a master plugin such as the official master files), you will also have to renumber (compact) them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to convert an ESP to ESL, you will have to flag it as ESL and rename the file extension from ESP to ESL. Any ESL can be converted to an ESP-Lite by simply changing the file extension from ESL to ESP.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-inis">Plugin INIs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Plugins can load INI files that have the same name, for example &lt;strong>Grass Plugin.esp&lt;/strong> would load &lt;strong>Grass Plugin.ini&lt;/strong>. One can then add any line that appears in Skyrim.ini with the exception of lines that also appear in SkyrimPrefs.ini. The INI settings defined in plugin INIs will overwrite the originals from the Skyrim.ini.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One popular use case is grass mods like in the example above. By default, the line &lt;code>iMinGrassSize&lt;/code> in Skyrim.ini has a value of 60 for vanilla grass density. Grass mods typically lower this value, thereby increasing the grass density, and they often do this through a plugin INI. This eliminates the need of editing the base INI files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="load-order--conflicts">Load Order &amp;amp; Conflicts&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="example-load-order">Example Load Order&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We already established that ESMs load at the top of your load order, followed by your ESLs and eventually your ESPs. The load order is essentially a list of all your plugins. Since they overwrite each other, it is important to sort them correctly. Here is what your load order with different types of plugins may look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bold&lt;/strong> indicates an ESM, &lt;em>Cursive&lt;/em> indicates an ESL.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skyrim.esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Update.esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dawnguard.esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>HearthFires.esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dragonborn.esm&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&lt;/strong> &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>an ESM-ified ESP&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>&lt;strong>DwemerGatesNoRelock.esl&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>an ESM-ified ESL&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lanterns of Skyrim.esm&lt;/strong> &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>a regular ESM&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Disarming Traps Is Dangerous.esl&lt;/em> &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>a regular ESL&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SkyUI.esp &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>a regular ESP&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Modern Brawl Bug Fix.esp&lt;/em> &amp;laquo;&amp;lt; &lt;code>an ESL-ified ESP&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Replace the above with a screenshot from the SkyPlus setup once that&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-rule-of-one">The Rule of One&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The data inside those plugins is saved and sorted in the form of &lt;strong>records&lt;/strong>. Each record has its own unique &lt;strong>Form ID&lt;/strong> which is used to identify and link to it. These records function like layers, and only the one on the top can be read – it covers up all those below. If one of the layers below the one on top edits the same record, a conflict arises. This is also referred to as &lt;strong>The Rule of One&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To elaborate, here is a simplified example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugin A.esp&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Record 1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Record 2&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugin B.esp&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Record 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Record 3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our two example plugins both edit two records, and both of them touch Record 2. This is a conflict! Since &lt;strong>Plugin B&lt;/strong> is lower in the load order, it will overwrite &lt;strong>Plugin A&lt;/strong> and its version of Record 2 will be loaded in the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="load-order-adjustments">Load Order Adjustments&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="the-solution">The Solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why patches &amp;amp; manual CR are essential.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why LOOT, Merged Patch, and Bashed Patch aren&amp;rsquo;t the be-all-and-end-all.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="assets">Assets&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="file-types">File Types&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Assets&amp;rdquo; is the general term for all kinds of loose files, such as textures, meshes, and scripts. All vanilla assets are stored within 18 &lt;strong>Bethesda Softworks Archives&lt;/strong> (or BSAs) which in turn are located inside your &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong> folder. These BSAs work much like ZIP or RAR archives - they contain loose files, compressed to save space, and require specific software to un- or re-pack them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the most popular filetypes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Textures&lt;/strong> – DDS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meshes –&lt;/strong> NIF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scripts&lt;/strong> – PEX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Script Source -&lt;/strong> PSC &lt;em>only required if you want to edit and recompile scripts; otherwise they can be ignored&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interface&lt;/strong> – SWF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sounds, Music&lt;/strong> – XWM / WAV&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Voices&lt;/strong> – FUZ&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(SKSE) Plugins&lt;/strong> – DLL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Animations, Skeleton&lt;/strong> – HKX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Configuration Files&lt;/strong> – INI / XML / JSON&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="bethesda-softworks-archives">Bethesda Softworks Archives&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As mentioned, BSAs are used to store and compress loose files. Every BSA must be attached to a plugin with the same name; for instance, &lt;strong>Snow.bsa&lt;/strong> would be loaded by &lt;strong>Snow.esp&lt;/strong> and not &lt;strong>Trees.esp&lt;/strong>. Without an active plugin to load it, a BSA will not be recognised and used by the game. The plugin can be a &amp;ldquo;dummy&amp;rdquo;: an empty plugin that contains no records. Files can be packed into BSAs using a tool that is included in the Creation Kit installation and extracted with community-made tools such as Bethesda Archive Extractor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Occasionally, you may come across ESP+BSA combinations with one &lt;strong>Snow.bsa&lt;/strong> and one &lt;strong>Snow - textures.bsa&lt;/strong>. The second archive contains, as the name suggests, only textures (DDS files), and it will be loaded as usual by &lt;strong>Snow.esp&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also an uncompressed variant of BSAs, which is used to store sound and music files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regular BSAs (&lt;strong>Example.bsa&lt;/strong>) for Skyrim SE must be 2GB or smaller, while texture BSAs (&lt;strong>Example - textures.bsa&lt;/strong>) versions may be a little larger. This is why the assets of larger mods (and of Skyrim SE itself) are split up into multiple archives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mod-order">Mod Order&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="loose-files">Loose Files&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Assets in your mod order overwrite each other just like records from plugins do in your load order, although it is a bit more straightforward here. If, for instance, &lt;strong>Mod A&lt;/strong> contains one version of the texture &lt;strong>Example.dds&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Mod B&lt;/strong> contains a different version, the mod that is loaded lower will overwrite.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mod A&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Example.dds&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mod B&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Example.dds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="packed-files">Packed Files&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Things get more complicated once BSAs are added to the mix. Packed assets are by default overwritten by loose assets &lt;em>regardless&lt;/em> of mod order. Let’s assume &lt;strong>Mod C&lt;/strong> also contains &lt;strong>Example.dds&lt;/strong>. However, it is packed in a BSA. In this case, &lt;strong>Mod B&lt;/strong> would still overwrite:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mod A&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Example.dds&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mod B&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Example.dds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mod C&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Example.bsa {&lt;del>Example.dds&lt;/del>}&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="load-order">Load Order&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Assets packed within BSAs overwrite based on the load order of their plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugin A.esp&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plugin A.bsa {&lt;del>Example.dds&lt;/del>}&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugin B.esp&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plugin B.bsa {Example.dds}&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="porting-le-mods-to-se">Porting LE mods to SE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The vast majority of mods created for Skyrim LE (the 2011 version) can easily be ported to Skyrim SE (2016 remaster). Many of them do not in fact need any additional steps and can immediately be installed for SE.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugins&lt;/strong> must be re-saved in the Creation Kit, a procedure that may seem daunting at first but can be completed within a minute.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Archives&lt;/strong> must be extracted and potentially repacked. Attempting to run Skyrim SE with an active LE BSA will result in a crash on launch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Textures&lt;/strong> are usually fine and can be used in SE, although some may benefit from a different type of compression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meshes&lt;/strong> can cause all kinds of issues up to and including crashes. They must be run through Cathedral Assets Optimizer or SSE NIF Optimizer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Animations&lt;/strong> are usually fine but may also be run through Cathedral Assets Optimizer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SKSE Plugins&lt;/strong> can be ported by people capable of recompiling and updating them in Visual Studio if the original source code is publicly available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ENBSeries presets&lt;/strong> cannot be ported to SE as both the game’s as well as SE ENB shaders have changed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All other file types, such as scripts, sounds, and interface (shockwave files) are generally safe to be used in SE.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
